China has been handed the biggest foreign policy win by simply offering business and help while not antagonizing the entire world, and I don't think anyone in the Trump administration realizes that.",

Since then, they have been able to keep the civilian population largely out of harms way, though imperfectly, which is why the death toll was largely reduced in the second year of fighting.\n\nTaken together.

        "body": "Calling Israel a \u201cgenocidal state\u201d is not criticism. It is a blood libel. It is a deliberate, malicious distortion of reality meant to delegitimise the only Jewish state on Earth. Do you want to talk about genocide? Look at the Yazidis, the Rohingya, Rwanda, and the Uyghurs. Do not insult the memory of real genocides by weaponising the term to slander a democracy defending itself from Islamist death cults that openly call for genocide.\n\nRepeating what certain NGOs or UN \u201cexperts\u201d say does not automatically make something credible. These same bodies have a long, well-documented history of obsessive and disproportionate focus on Israel while remaining silent on atrocities in Syria, Yemen, Iran, or China. That is not moral clarity. That is political bias.\n\nNow, let us look at the facts. Genocide has a clear legal definition: intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. If Israel were committing genocide, Gaza would no longer exist. Instead, Israel warns civilians before strikes, allows aid through, and targets a terror regime that uses its population as shields by embedding weapons in schools, hospitals, and mosques.\n\nCalling Jews baby killers and accusing the Jewish state of genocide while excusing or ignoring the massacre of 1,200 civilians on October 7 fits the historical pattern of antisemitic defamation. It is not legal commentary. It is vilification.\n\nSpain, by the way, has no moral high ground to lecture anyone. This is the same country that expelled its Jews in 1492, aided Franco\u2019s bombing of civilians in Guernica, and stayed neutral while the Holocaust unfolded. Spare us the sanctimony. When a country with virtually no Jews left suddenly finds its moral voice only when it is time to condemn the Jewish state, that is not justice. That is projection.\n\nLet us not pretend this is about human rights. You are not standing up for the oppressed. You are just comfortable with antisemitism so long as it is dressed up as \u201canti-Zionism.\u201d Denying Jews a homeland, blaming them for defending themselves, and cheering when others call them Nazis is textbook antisemitism.\n\nCriticism is not the issue. Israel, like any healthy democracy, is constantly scrutinised by its citizens, its courts, and its media. But when criticism becomes a campaign of demonisation, when you apply double standards, erase context, and excuse terror while condemning self-defence, you are not advocating. You are dehumanising.\n\nIsrael is not perfect. No country is. But it is the only one in the Middle East where Arabs vote, LGBTQ rights are protected, and journalists are not silenced. If your moral compass leads you to demonise that state while giving actual tyrannies a free pass, it is not justice you are after. It is vengeance.\n\nSo, no, my moral compass is not broken. It is just not calibrated to hate a nation for surviving.",

Tanks and armoured personnel carriers stood in the square; soldiers on the tanks told her they had been there, waiting for Caetano to surrender, since three in the morning. Not surprisingly one of them, calling her \u201cMa\u2019am\u201d most politely, asked her for a cigarette.  He looked exhausted. She felt sorry for him, but she didn\u2019t smoke and never had, because she was so chesty. Perhaps she could buy him a sandwich? No, everywhere was closed. So, reaching up on tiptoe, she gave him a carnation.\n\nHe did not have to accept it. He could have laughed at her, or tossed it away. Many men would have done: her own father, or Helena\u2019s father, the ones who walked  out on women. But he took it gladly, and put it in the barrel of his rifle. That meant he could not shoot now; and suddenly, his comrades also wanted one. They would be an army of peace. Her flowers ran out, but soon other people brought carnations too, including all the florists who worried, like Mr Chaves, that their stock would die otherwise.\n\nBack in the flat in Chiado later, she stood at the window watching. People filled the streets, and many had carnations. It made her smile. By the evening, Caetano had surrendered. Her mother cried \u201cYou could have been shot!\u201d, but she had never thought that. The whole thing seemed almost accidental. She had offered a soldier a flower. He had stuck it into his gun. This had turned into a statement that grew stronger and stronger. Peace against war (only four people died in this revolution); good against evil; freedom against oppression; new versus old. It was a statement that resonated far beyond Portugal, especially in Africa, where one by one the former colonies gained their independence.",

It ended nearly 50 years of authoritarian rule under the Estado Novo regime. The revolution not only restored democracy but also triggered the decolonization of Portuguese territories in Africa and paved the way for Europe\u2019s first socialist constitution in 1976. Its peaceful nature and sweeping impact make it one of the most significant democratic transitions of the 20th century.\n\nThe **Carnation Revolution** was triggered by a song broadcast on the radio as a secret signal to launch the coup. On the night of **April 24, 1974**, at **10:55 p.m.**, the banned song **\u201cE Depois do Adeus\u201d** by Paulo de Carvalho was played on **Emissores Associados de Lisboa**. This served as the first signal to alert the conspirators that the operation was about to begin.\n\nThen, at **12:20 a.m. on April 25**, a second song\u2014**\u201cGr\u00e2ndola, Vila Morena\u201d** by Zeca Afonso\u2014was played on **R\u00e1dio Renascen\u00e7a**. This was the definitive signal for the MFA to move forward with the coup. The song, which celebrated fraternity and equality, had been censored under the regime, so its airing was itself a powerful symbol of defiance.\n\nThese musical signals coordinated military actions across the country without alerting the regime\u2014making it a revolution not just led by soldiers, but also sparked by songs.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Originally written in Portuguese and revised and translated by AI. details about the songs were 100% by AI.",

Their [minister of economy had to resign](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66066910) and the leader of the party [was caught writing hateful content online](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66166795). The Prime Minister (of a different party, to clarify), held a \"rules talk\" with the Finns' Party ministers and [decided, as a gesture of 'zero tolerance for racism', to move towards criminalizing Holocaust denial and displaying the swastika](https://yle.fi/a/74-20047962). This was in August 2023. \n\nAfter half a year of nothing coming of it, it was reported that the [Justice Minister had intentionally stalled the advancement of the law](https://www.savonsanomat.fi/uutissuomalainen/6717698) (she's also a member of the Finns Party). \n\nNow, it's worth noting that holocaust denial is already covered by the definition of the crime of \"inciting against a group of people\", carrying a maximum penalty of two years in prison. This has been the case for ages. It just hasn't been explicit, and the EU commission has previously criticized this.\n\nIn the autumn of 2024, our government, preparing this new law specifically criminalizing the holocaust, [proposed *lowering* the maximum sentence from what it was under the other criminal code](https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/hs-hallitus-aikoo-lieventaa-rangaistuksia-holokaustin-kiistamisesta/9003814). \n\nNow it finally seems to be coming to fruition. But it's worth keeping in mind that the right-wing Finns Party in the government dragged their feet every single step of the way to this point.",

Both for the sake of peace and out of fear of communism, the decision was made to sweep everything under the carpet and start again. The fact is that you can still be born a fascist in Italy. A large part of the population has never accepted the fall of fascist Italy and believes in a glorious past made possible by mussolini. The reality is very different, and anyone who has studied a bit knows that. But the problem is that in schools, and more generally in the media, fascism is glossed over. You see a lot of films in which Nazis are the bad guys, but films in which Fascists are the bad guys are much rarer. If a professor at school says something against fascism, then they say they are a communist spreading lies. Basically, no matter what evidence you can give, the fascist part of Italy sees it as a lie. They believe that fascist Italy was heaven on earth and that Italy was respected internationally when mussolini was in power, even though it is really far from the truth.\n\nIn Italy today there is still a huge divide in the population. The civil war, which we didn't resolve, has been passed on to the new generations. All the right-wing political parties reject every year the celebration of 25 April, the day on which we celebrate the end of nazifascism in Italy. \"Bella Ciao\", a song associated with the resistance against fascism, is despised by right-wing parties and people.\n\nThis is so sad in everyday life. To hear people I grew up with or I work with say nice things about fascism. To see that in mussolini's hometown people still go to the pilmgrinage.\n\nIt's exhausting, to be honest. And the problem is that you can't reason with these people: for them, fascism is like a religion, and they don't believe in anything else than what they learned in their homes growing up.",

We need to realize that much of our culture has a fascist stamp, even in the little things of everyday life, it is no coincidence that it was invented in Italy. So instead of tearing our teeth out every time we see these fascists, let's answer them on the points. the one in the photo is a commemoration, as incredible as it is, it is not a gathering of politicians who want to restore a fascist dictatorship (maybe only in their mind, they love to be free like us) so configuring it as an apology could be thorny. Personally I think we need to let them do it, the best response I saw was that of a disgusted resident who turned on the song \"bella ciao\" (absolute chad) while they were doing a minute of silence. two notes of a little song were enough to send them into delirium.\n\nIt's a battle that must be fought on a cultural and intimate-family level guys, I bet there are a lot of \"racist uncles\" of some of you in there. \n\nwhat I'm trying to tell you is that we really have to take the leap and come to terms with this stuff, guys this is the time to be cold and cynical like rocks in Antarctica if we want to get rid of this fascist culture once and for all, and as strange as it may sound to you if these exist it is also thanks to an opposition and a left inept and disconnected from reality. Not even the opposition has done anything to stop these groups of nostalgics so let's not be surprised, let's learn to fight these enemies with something that they hate, freedom of thought and expression, and the data and the science. like in school if you hit hard you see that those donkeys will understand, it will take years, decades and we will have to see many of them die of old age before we get rid of them. but that's how it is, for me this is the way. \n\nI would also like to say one last thing, as much as Italian culture is steeped in fascism there was also an Italy that at the time resisted and fought for years, a culture that created partisans and citizens who loved freedom, precisely, anti-fascists. spoiler they were \"few\" at the time (enough to beat hard though). and in the second post-war period we still struggle to recognize that essentially we had to pull out a democracy from a country in which the citizens were mostly fascists.",

The successive governments, for reasons of votes and out of sheer impudence, have always pretended not to see them. It\u2019s only natural that in today\u2019s historical moment these demonstrations are becoming more concerning, especially when we have a government in which the Speaker of the House proudly displays a bust of Mussolini at home and brags about it publicly, or the Prime Minister who, in several past videos, said Mussolini was a great man and even founded a party based on that belief.\n\nThe real issue is that we are crushed daily by abuses from our own neighbors. We have starvation wages, a tax burden that doesn\u2019t match the level of services and infrastructure we receive, unstable jobs, undeclared work, underpaid jobs\u2014or all of the above. The average Italian thinks about how to scam the state by getting benefits they don\u2019t actually need. There\u2019s no oversight of many entrepreneurs who declare nothing to the tax authorities, and there\u2019s no serious fight against corruption, illegal construction, and tax evasion at any level.\n\nAmong all this, there are also fascists who hope that by bringing fascism back to Italy, things will get better\u2014when in fact it was one of, if not *the* most disastrous chapter in Italian history. But as many say\u2014and they\u2019re right\u2014fascism seems more like a religion than a political movement.\n\nFinally, most people in Italy don\u2019t give a damn about which political party is in power, as long as corruption, illegal construction, and tax evasion continue\u2014the things they love so much. A few people, especially young ones, are fed up with this situation, but we\u2019re a minority, as shown by the huge number of young people leaving Italy every year. And who can blame them...\n\nAs a recommendation, I suggest watching the series *Mussolini*, which gives a good overview of just how grotesque, violent, and ridiculous Mussolini and his party truly were.",

He took me on bicycle rides to the park. He always laughed and never screamed. He kept the family together. \n\nOne day, he stepped on a rusty nail. He didn't think much of it. He never told anyone. Until the pain came. Every step he took, it was agony. He went to the hospital reluctantly. (We weren't poor, but we weren't rich either. He was worried about the costs.) The doctor told him his foot was infected, his toes were black, he could either cut his toes off, but the infection could come back, or his foot, as it was much safer. My grandfather, the chose the more conservative option and removed only some of the toes. \n\nHe was never the same after. He didn't smile like he used to, even if he tried.\n\nThe infection came back. It took his whole leg this time. He didn't smile anymore. He was sour, he hated everything but me, I looked the most like him. My cousins were treated badly. They didn't look like him, not really. He became abusive and violent, even if he couldn't put his mouth where his words were.\n\nHe lost the ability to walk altogether. He needed a wheelchair, and he would cough all the time. Then he died. I didn't feel bad. Because he was bad. Not my family, though. They cried because they saw him as human, but all I saw was a shell of a human being. He died somewhere in-between, I can't really point where, but I know it was when he started treating his own family as shit.\n\nTLDR: Fascists are an infection. It must be cut out and treated entirely, not left to fester. Once they stop treating others as humans, that is the day they lose all rights to be called human.",

I mean sure there is plenty my country does that I\u2019m proud of, but not in the same way.  \nI feel like with a country like Italy, it\u2019s not all that surprising that someone like Mussolini would come around, and it\u2019s not that surprising that these attitudes would stick around. Because *everyone* knows about the Roman Empire. A lot of people know that Britain was first colonized by Rome, that half of Europe was part of Rome. That Rome was one of the most dominant empires in history. Roman architecture is still all over Europe and Latin Languages would be the most spoken languages in the world, considering a huge percentage of English is based in Latin too.  \nMake Italy great again works on many levels, and at the moment they are not doing as well as they were in the past.",

He spent years in Peru as a seminary rector and bishop, overseeing priestly formation at the Major Seminary of Chiclayo, building formation groups and job programs among indigenous and urban communities. He then ran the Dicastery for Bishops in Rome. That is the Vatican office responsible for vetting episcopal candidates, managing leadership transitions, and shaping the global face of the Church. He was made a cardinal in 2023: elevated by Francis in recognition of his blend of pastoral sensitivity and leadership savvy, granting him a key voice in guiding the church.\n\nWith this being such a quick vote it likely points to a consensus pick for a steady, admin-like pope who\u2019ll likely keep Francis\u2019 pastoral focus but bring more structure. This suggests the cardinals rallied around someone who combines Francis' emphases, approachability, and political savvy with clear governance.\n\nChoosing \u201cLeo\u201d probably nods to Leo the Great\u2019s doctrinal emphasis (defined Chalcedonian Christology, defended the two natures of Christ, and reinforced papal primacy) and maybe Leo XIII\u2019s social teaching (modern catholic social teaching emphasizing the rights of labor and emphasis on protecting the poor). I\u2019d expect a mix of firm theology and social engagement: a pontificate marked by robust doctrinal clarity alongside continued outreach to the marginalized.\n\nEdit: expand on some questions I've got.",

Trump flirted with authoritarianism but still lost an election and dipped.\n\nActual Violence: Mussolini\u2019s Blackshirts beat and killed political opponents. Trump incited a mob but didn\u2019t institutionalize violence on a national level.\n\nForeign Adventures: Mussolini invaded countries; Trump mostly just rage-tweeted at Canada and started no new wars.\n\nReal Ideology: Mussolini had an actual fascist blueprint.

On arriving in the city in the early hours of 29 April, they were dumped on the ground in the\u00a0[Piazzale Loreto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Loreto), a suburban square near the\u00a0[main railway station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milano_Centrale_railway_station).[^(\\[51\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-55)[^(\\[52\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Bosworth332-56)\u00a0The choice of location was deliberate. Fifteen partisans had been\u00a0[shot there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Loreto_massacre)\u00a0in August 1944 in retaliation for partisan attacks and Allied bombing raids, and their bodies had then been left on public display. At the time, Mussolini is said to have remarked \"for the blood of Piazzale Loreto, we shall pay dearly\".[^(\\[52\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Bosworth332-56)\n\nTheir bodies were left in a heap, and by 9:00\u00a0a.m. a considerable crowd had gathered. The corpses were pelted with vegetables, spat at, urinated on, shot at and kicked; Mussolini's face was disfigured by beatings.[^(\\[53\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Luzzatto68-57)[^(\\[54\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Moseley313-58)\u00a0Allied forces began arriving in the city during the course of the morning and an American eyewitness described the crowd as \"sinister, depraved, out of control\".[^(\\[54\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Moseley313-58)\u00a0After a while, the bodies were hung by their feet from the metal girder framework of a half-built service station.[^(\\[53\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Luzzatto68-57)[^(\\[54\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Moseley313-58)[^(\\[55\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-59)\u00a0This mode of hanging had been used in northern Italy since medieval times to stress the \"infamy\" of the hanged. However, the reason given by those involved in hanging Mussolini and the others in this way was to protect the bodies from the mob. Movie footage of what happened appears to confirm that to be the case.[^(\\[56\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-60)",

Sure, I belong to a nationality and sure I have a home country, but I feel like the EU represents the best side of all of us. The cooperation, the opportunities, the fact that we could move on from senseless wars and conflicts and prosper together. I love living here, on the continent, I love the fact that I can move and retire in any states as I wish, and I view the same thing with other EU citizens. We all share a such a colorful history together, let it be good or bad and the fact that this union exists is the livig testament I think to what us Europeans can do together.\n\nI don't care about what generalisations politicians can bring onto a whole nation, or however tense some situations may be, the common European man will always be kind, open, and passionate about one another.\n\nSo as a last note, thank you EU, for being the basis for the best of humanity, and thank you for being my personal light of hope in a world that sees so much negativity and despair. I hope one day we'll be able to be a respected part of humanity's brightest community.",

There was a blizzard and people got stuck on the highway, fuck emergency services there he is jumping out of black mercedes in leather shoes grabbing a kid from parents in the car and he disappeared in the snow like a hero in the night saving him (im not even joking, just so happens that a TV crew from one of his paid journalist was there to capture that on camera). Once one of those journalists dared to ask him a question he did not approve before he had a meltdown and told his voters that that television went rogue and can't be trusted anymore. He always calls for dialogue and discussion but NEVER in those 13 years have I seen him in a studio with a member of the opposition party.

Of the 5 major groups that voted Leave 4 of them have felt the consequences.  \n  \nThe old that voted to leave were killed during covid reducing the leave vote.  \nThe farmers realised that not only do we import Agriculture, we also exported it too borderline tariff free while they reaped EU Subsidies, so not only did they lose the subsidies, they realised they weren't gonna strong arm Supermarkets into paying whatever they wanted.  \nThe fishermen realised the same as the farmers that leaving the EU restricts the waters they can actively fish in making it harder to get the yield they were prior.  \nThe inept realised that Nigel Farage wasn't gonna put 350M a week to the NHS like the bus said.\n\nMeaning the 5th group, the rich who wanted to abuse UK Tax laws, and the stupid that think Reform UK and Nigel Farage want to give the NHS a \u00a317BN cash injection are the ones left voting no. Ironically enough, Nigel telling people to leave is the exact reason we can't \"Send the boats back to France\" like his voter base wants because we're no longer part of the Dublin Agreement.\n\nOne of the major terms of Brexit was that if we ever rejoined, we wouldn't be given the same treatment as the first time around and we'd have to drop the \u00a3 and adopt the \u20ac, which will be hardest point to sell to the public.",

The process involves two main steps:  \n\n1. **Determining a \"Serious Breach\" of EU Values**  \n   - Requires **unanimous agreement** from all **other** member states.  \n   - **Hungary is excluded** from this vote and **cannot veto the decision**.  \n   - If approved, Hungary is officially classified as breaching EU principles.  \n\n2. **Suspending Hungary\u2019s Voting Rights**  \n   - Uses **Qualified Majority Voting (QMV)** instead of requiring **unanimity**.  \n   - Approval requires:  \n     - **55% of EU countries** (at least **15 out of 27**).  \n     - **65% of the EU population** to be represented.  \n\n### **Countries Required to Meet 65% Population Threshold**  \nThe five largest EU countries **(Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland)** together **exceed 65%** of the total EU population (**66% total**).  \n\nIf **Poland opposes the motion**, it needs to be replaced with another **8% of the EU population**. Possible alternative combinations include:  \n\n\u2705 **Romania (4.2%) + Netherlands (4.0%)** \u2192 **8.2%**  \n\u2705 **Romania (4.2%) + Belgium (2.6%) + Czechia (2.4%)** \u2192 **9.2%**  \n\u2705 **Romania (4.2%) + Portugal (2.4%) + Sweden (2.3%)** \u2192 **8.9%**  \n\nWith one of these combinations, the **65% population threshold can still be met**, allowing Hungary\u2019s **voting rights to be suspended**.  \n\n---\n\n### **References**  \n- **EU Council Explanation of Article 7**: [https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/article-7-procedures/](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/article-7-procedures/)  \n- **EU Qualified Majority Voting Rules**: [https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/)  \n- **EU Member State Populations (Eurostat)**: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography)  \n\nSource: CoPilot / ChatGPT",

And Britain held out at against the Nazis pretty much alone for two years.

        "body": "**The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has reassessed the AfD at federal level. According to this, there is no longer any doubt that the party as a whole is right-wing extremist.**\n\nPreviously, the AfD was classified as a right-wing extremist \u201csuspected case\u201d and monitored by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. This morning, the Federal Office informed the public that the party as a whole is now classified as a \u201cproven right-wing extremist organization\u201d. A press release states that the evidence has \u201cintensified\u201d, meaning that the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has proven that the AfD as a whole is right-wing extremist and against the free democratic basic order. The decision means a significant tightening of the assessment, but it does not come as a complete surprise.\n\n**1,000-page report**\n\nThe basis for this is an extensive collection of material that has been repeatedly updated by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution: According to information from ARD-Hauptstadtstudio and SWR, the Federal Office's report comprises more than 1,000 pages and is intended to prove why the AfD is anti-constitutional in the opinion of the constitutional protectors. The decisive factors are violations of human dignity, the rule of law or the principle of democracy, and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution distinguishes between test cases, suspected cases and \"proven extremist tendencies\". The AfD was initially classified as a test case by the Federal Office at federal level in 2019. At this stage, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is only allowed to collect and evaluate public statements made by AfD functionaries, and the AfD resisted both the observation by the domestic intelligence service and the fact that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution made this evaluation public from day one. In February 2021, the AfD was upgraded to a suspected right-wing extremist party, which was initially declared lawful by the Cologne Administrative Court and, in May 2024, also by the M\u00fcnster Higher Administrative Court after the party filed a lawsuit.\n\n**Observation of the AfD**\n\nWith the classification as a suspected case, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution may also use so-called intelligence means for observation, such as recruiting human sources or conducting financial investigations. Measures to monitor communications are also permitted, but only with the prior approval of the G10 Commission of the German Bundestag. A final decision by the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig on the question of whether the classification as a suspected case is lawful is still pending. However, this is no longer about the substantive justification, but solely about possible procedural errors in the classification. In its ruling, the M\u00fcnster Higher Administrative Court had also called on the Office for the Protection of the Constitution to come to an assessment soon as to whether the suspicion of extremism had been confirmed or not.\n\nThe upgrade to \"proven right-wing extremist organization\" had already been expected last year. According to reports, however, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution initially refrained from doing so due to the early Bundestag elections, so as not to be accused of violating the equal opportunities of the parties in the election campaign.it is considered certain that the AfD will also take legal action against the reassessment by the Federal Office. In public, the AfD has always described the observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution as politically motivated. Individual state associations of the party have already been classified as proven right-wing extremist: in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. As of today, the federal party has also been classified.\n\n**Will there be a ban procedure?**\n\nThe reassessment by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is likely to reignite the debate about banning the AfD. However, there is no automaticity: the assessment as \"proven right-wing extremist\" is neither a prerequisite for this, nor is a ban procedure the inevitable consequence.it is rather a political decision: a ban procedure can only be initiated by the Bundestag, Bundesrat and Federal Government by applying to the Federal Constitutional Court, which then has to decide on it.an initiative for a ban application from the middle of the Bundestag, initiated by the then CDU member of the Bundestag Marco Wanderwitz, failed in January because there were not enough supporters.",

This isn't to mock or demean\u2014but rather to highlight the tragic irony.\n\nThe Nazi regime, which many AfD supporters indirectly glorify, systematically murdered people with physical and mental disabilities under Aktion T4. It's heartbreaking that some of those who might have been targeted under that regime are now defending a movement with roots in such ideology.\n\nAdding to the contradictions, Alice Weidel, a co-leader of the AfD, lives in open contrast to her party\u2019s stance\u2014she is in a same-sex partnership with a woman of Sri Lankan origin. The hypocrisy is staggering.\n\nIt\u2019s as irrational as it is sad.",

Specifically, the view that people who don't have a german lineage can be stripped of their German citizenship and excluded from the country. That's a very dangerous idea.\n\nBut I came here to say. If the afd legitimately get into power and legally change the constitution to remove the protection for those people, then it would be just as dangerous for the german state to work against the democratically elected authority in the land. \n\nI see a lot of troubling things about Germany lately. There is an emerging feeling that there is an elite class of officials that have appointed themselves as the guards the \"real\" values of germany. You see it from Merkel who said that Israel's security should be treated as an extension of Germany's security. That isn't illegal, until Germany steps over someone actual legal rights to uphold an non legal official maxim like that. This happened recently with the Irish protestors for Palestinian being stripped of their right to live and work in Berlin. \n\nAnd now we see the foreign office not being very careful to distinguish a threat to the unofficial state posed by afd people who want to legally change the constitution, to a group using force  or illegal means to threaten German citizens rights under the current constitution.\n\nIt's all quite concerning that official Germany is setting up to resist a democratically elected govt and justifying everything with things that happened in WW2.

        "body": "Yeah I am not a fan of what most of the Political Parties in Germany do, and I admit I voted for them once before, but their stance on Russia is what finally opened my eyes.\n\nTo any AfD Voters reading this: It\u2018s not the foreigners fault this country is going to shit. It\u2018s the widening gap between rich and poor and the flow of wealth in the form of assets from the bottom to the top. And NO party, especially not the AfD, has answers for that.\n\nI would describe myself als patriotic. This is why I will never support a party that is advocating or even collaborating with an entity that seeks to undermine our freedom, values and rights, and entity that wants to invade and conquer our neighbors and allies. We know from our history, and from all of history, that this kind of behavior ALWAYS ends the same way.\n\nIf you are a patriot I really feel with you. This current situation is bad. But kicking out foreigners and cuddling up to an imperialist dictator is NOT the way. This has not worked before and it will not work this time.\n\nDon\u2018t get me wrong, I really don\u2018t advocate for communism or socialism - but we need to talk about wealth inequality as driving force behind most of the problems we face today and deal with that adequately, or NOTHING will ever change and everything will just keep getting worse.\n\nI know this was kind of off topic, but I know there are a lot of silent AfD Voters here who are just so fed up with the way things are developing.\n\nI know what you feel like. I know money is tight. I know you have dreams and ambitions. I know you work hard. I know it really makes you angry when you see these out of touch politicians talk shit on TV. I feel you and I agree 100%.\n\nBut it\u2018s not the foreigners fault. And the AfD has NO solution to the core problem - but the other parties also do not.\n\nSo if you are a patriot and fed up with how things are going: Educate yourself about wealth inequality, the stock market, the flow of assets and what that really means for all of us and you will get a really good look behind the curtain.\n\nAnd that\u2018s also true for most Americans. The tariffs show that even the Trump administration understood the issue with asset flow and are ready to tank the economy to have it transform itself over a very long time; but that is also only a bandaid. There are certain rules in international trade. Inform yourself what really happens when one nation has a trade deficit with another country. This will not fix the housing prices in the short term. In ten years or so, if the administration keeps it up and your local production change, maybe. There are a lot of things at play here. But think about it this way: The sweatpants you buy are mostly made in Cambodia where labor is cheap. Trump wants to make local US production competitive with products made in countries with cheap labor, like Cambodia. Now think it through: Cambodia is one of the poorest nations on earth, yet was hit with some of the biggest tariffs by Trump. Still, if you would make these products in the US, image how low the pay would have to be to still be to get to a competitive price for produced goods. Do you want to work for $4 and hour? Is that an economy you want? I don\u2018t think so.\n\nI could go on for hours and hours writing about this, but I think I already took it too far. Thanks for coming to my TED talk I guess. \n\nHate never wins.",

They keep using post-WWII extreme right rhetoric that was popular in very small, hidden nazi circles in the last 80 years. The question is why they do it and how many in the party actually believe that stuff. My guess is that a fraction of the party is highly opportunistic, so even nazi ideas are fine as long as they grant them influence and power, but in the lower ranks is full of real nazis because these were the only people that they could recruit here and there.   \nBut regardless of what Rubio says, every country has to live/deal somehow with extreme right parties, I think Germany has to learn to do it as well, eventually. Years ago, these hardcore conservatives were hidden in the CDU and had to be very disciplined, christian, well-behaved etc. They existed, but they had to keep a certain low profile so they wouldn't go around babbling about nazi stuff. They would however maybe say that it's sad that we lost Breslau or Stettin because they were so nice. Or they would show support for a high-ranking official of the Wehrmacht who massacred civilians in Italy or Poland. Only that people don't remember that anymore after 50-60 years. After all you cannot pretend that because something terrible happened 80 years ago then your population is somehow special and therefore people with far right ideas do not exist because you taught them in school that the Nazis were bad.",

Seems like some regions in Spain are getting power back. Rumor says it was caused by a cyber attack. There is a meeting of authorities in the next few minutes, we will get clarity about the causes in the following hours.\n\nUpdate 3: after about an hour with electricity, power is down again. The director of Red El\u00e9ctrica said it could take between six and ten hours to restore electricity in all Spain. It is a gradual process.\n\nUpdate 4: after 6+ hours without Internet and electricity, though luckily I could use a generator for a few hours, power is restored. About 50% of electricity has been restored in Spain, but that process is asymmetric geographically speaking.\n\nUpdate 5: Well it has been officially denied that there was a cyber attack. It is practically confirmed by now that the massive outage was caused by the grid not being sufficient to handle so much energy generation caused by renewables. Renewables are expanding at a much higher pace than the expansion of the capacity of the electric network to handle it. So you could say we are a victim of our own success. There are plans to expand the capacity of the grid in 2026, so in the meantime either more blackouts could happen or we will have to disconnect some renewables or other power generators.",

There are also some reports in this thread of power having come back in the Basque region. In short, there is still a lot of uncertainty, which is not unsurprising given that this appears to be a highly unusual event. At least nothing so far points towards a Russian attack and it is therefore unlikely that other European countries outside of the Iberian peninsula will be affected.\n\nThe source for the above is BBC's live coverage: https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c9wpq8xrvd9t",

It looks like he's written a couple of books that are mostly filled with dumb, \"Ultranationalist,\" as the article calls it, claims like that one. He's also the one that's been leading Russia's peace talks for... A long while now, according to the article. Most of those peace talks have been unsuccessful and continue to be.

There's still millions of us around lol, including nearly a million in Russia proper.\u00a0\n\n- The Kabardians were certainly not the \"only tribe to have survived\", honestly no clue where people are getting this from..\u00a0\n\n- Sochi wasn't our capital city at the time, it was a small port town for trade with the Ottomans, and only became relevant after the Russian conquest.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile this may seem like minor nitpicks to some, it's important to be factual when advocating for a cause and spreading information, as this otherwise plays right into the \"both sides are full of shit\" narrative that Russian propagandists try to spread, and does not help Circassians.\u00a0\n\n\nOn a lighter note, I'd encourage people to read about how Circassians have managed to carve out a place for themselves in exile around the Levant. Wikipedia has some great articles about us in different countries (The Jordanian royal guard being made of Circassians by tradition is probably my favorite).\u00a0\n\nHere's a few links:\u00a0\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians_in_Jordan\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians_in_Syria\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians_in_Egypt",

This is what the US Embassy demands in a letter, with a contract they expect the city to sign.\n\n- \u201cIt's completely bizarre,\u201d says Jan Valeskog (S), Mayor of Stockholm.\nText Mia Tottmar\n\nThe embassy begins the letter with \u201cDear City Planning Office\u201d and then explains that a new policy requires anyone from whom the US government purchases goods and services to sign the contract.\n\nThe Department of Public Works is expected to sign and return the contract within 10 business days.\n\n- We absolutely will not do that, it goes against everything we stand for. They should withdraw these oddities,\" says Jan Valeskog.\n\nIt is the embassy that benefits from the City of Stockholm, not the other way around, he believes.\n\n- If the US terminates its relationship with the City Planning Office, the embassy will find it difficult to obtain building permits if they want to rebuild, for example. \u201cThat's their headache, not ours,\u201d says Valeskog.\n\nAccording to the National Board of Housing, Building Permits are required for new construction, extensions and certain changes to the external appearance of buildings.    \nThe US embassy at G\u00e4rdet in Stockholm. Photo: Fredrik Sandberg/TT\n\nDN has previously reported that the USA has demanded the same of Swedish companies that supply goods and services. At the time, the embassy replied in an email to DN that \u201cU.S. missions are reviewing contracts and grants to ensure they comply with the White House's latest executive order\u201d.\n\nShortly after Trump was sworn in as president in January, he signed an executive order to scrap government-funded programs aimed at promoting inclusion, equality and diversity in the workplace.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)    \n\nEdit: formatting",

Even Denmark is.\n\nI hate to say it but if this was an \"awakening\" we barely opened one eye to go back to sleep ... if you look at it factually Trump is walking all over us. Even on duties - now we are going to buy more US Gas. Fine. I guess we need it. But that's exactly what Trump wants. Meanwhile all help to transition our economies have been drastically reduced... \n\nThe only ones that woke up are the Canadians (and to an extend) Australians who at least voted in Labour governments.

        "body": "The Stockholm City Council has rejected the US embassy's demands that it roll back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at the behest of the Trump administration.\n\nIn his inauguration speech, US President Donald Trump vowed to end what he sweepingly but vaguely called efforts to \u201csocially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life\u201d. \n\nThis has translated into attempts to eliminate programmes in the United States that seek to encourage diversity and equality in education, the work force and beyond.  \n\nIn an email to the city's planning office dated April 29, the US embassy asked that Stockholm officials sign a document promising that contractors would not operate any programmes promoting DEI that would violate current US law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre,\u201d Jan Valeskog, Stockholm\u2019s vice-mayor for city planning, told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Tuesday. \n\nThe city council said Friday that it would not comply with the embassy's demands or offer an official response.\n\n\u201cWe were really surprised, of course,\u201d Valeskog told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe will not sign this document at all, of course not.\u201d\n\nValeskog said that while the city wants to maintain a good relationship with the US embassy, it will follow Swedish law and current city policies even if they include DEI practices.\n\nCountries and cities across Europe have received similar demands from US embassies \u2013 including France, Belgium and the city of Barcelona \u2013 all of which have lashed out at the attempt to expand anti-diversity policies to the continent.\n\nREAD MORE\nTrump administration asks French companies to comply with DEI ban\n\nQuestionnaire sent to French firms\n\nThe US embassy in Paris sent letters in March to several French companies warning against pursuing diversity programmes.\n\nThe letters, sent to firms currently doing or looking to do business with the United States, included a questionnaire asking them to certify that they \"do not practice programmes to promote diversity, equity and inclusion\".\n\nThe questionnaire added that such programmes \"infringe on applicable federal anti-discrimination laws\" in the United States, where Trump signed an order banning federal DEI programmes the day he returned to office.\n\n\"We would be grateful if you could complete and sign the document in English within five days and return it to us by email,\" the letter read. \n\n\"If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal services,\" it added.\n\nThe letter told companies that Trump's January 20 executive order rescinding DEI programmes \"also applies to all contractors and suppliers of the US government, regardless of nationality or country of operations\".\n\nFrance lacks US-style DEI policies \n\nFrance hit back through its ministry of foreign trade.\n\n\"US interference in French companies' inclusion policies is unacceptable, just like its unjustified tariff threats,\" the ministry said.\n\n\"France and Europe will defend their companies, their consumers, but also their values.\"\n\nFrance does not have US-style affirmative action policies, and French law bans treating individuals differently based on origin, ethnic group or religion. Even conducting polls asking about ethnicity or religion is illegal. \n\nHowever, many large companies have sought to diversify their recruitment pools. A 2023 study found that close to 97 percent of French CEOs were White. \n\nFrance does require companies with more than 1,000 employees to try to promote gender equality, with benchmarks such as having at least 30 percent of executives be women.\n\nEconomy Minister Eric Lombard's office said the letter \"reflects the values of the new US government\" \u2013 but not French values.\n\n\"They are not ours,\" it said. \"The minister will remind his US counterparts of that.\"\n\nPlease support Shohei Ohtani and join us at r/shoheiohtani and r/shobaes",

Race and gender are already socially integrated into society you fucking dolt.

For them, race is just an abstract concept talked about on the news, in school or in social media.\n\nBut the most ironic thing is, these people DO suffer from gender norms. A lot (although nowhere near as much as women or trans people), but on the flip side they\u2019re immensely privileged as a gender in societal hierarchy, and to maintain that requires denying the hierarchy even exists. Men can be depressed and sad and have issues with conforming to completely artificial and harmful masculine traits and expectations society puts on them and still be like \u2018gender isn\u2019t real!\u2019 Well yes, if you deny that the main thing causing you harm doesn\u2019t even exist as a concept, then don\u2019t expect that pain to go away anytime soon.",

        "body": "Translation:\n\nThe dream trip was in full swing.\n\nAfter a month and a half in New Zealand, two young Danes, Frida and Uma, recently turned their compass towards the United States.\n\nNext stop: Hawaii.\n\nUma and Frida otherwise felt well prepared, but the great backpacking adventure into the world ended abruptly: With both girls in handcuffs, hours and days filled with uncertainty, deprivation of liberty, and an experience that today stands as a poignant reminder that there is not much room for the slightest blunder among American immigration authorities.\n\nFor three days, Uma and Frida had a good view of tall palm trees bathed in sunshine through a window.\n\nBut the half-head-wide window to the picturesque beaches of the Aloha Island was located in a massive gray brick building better known as the Honolulu Federal Detention Center - more or less the equivalent of a prison where the US government detains criminals, illegal immigrants and others whom the US authorities will not approve for entry into the United States.\n\nUma and Frida had a feeling that they had their papers in order when they stood in line at passport control at the airport after arriving in Honolulu.\n\nSeveral months earlier, they had completed and received approval for what for many Danes is entry to the United States, a so-called ESTA, a kind of pre-approval.\n\nThey were looking forward to visiting family and after meeting a German girl in New Zealand, they had made plans to do some volunteer work on an organic farm. The contact with the farm had been made through the organization WWOOF - World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farm.\n\n    As soon as I mention volunteer work, the officer tells me: You can just stop talking.\n    Uma\n\nTherefore, they had in no way imagined the course of events that followed after they stood at the passport control counter on the morning of April 23.\n\n- As soon as I mention volunteer work, the officer tells me: You can just stop talking, and then at about the same time we are taken up to a waiting room where there are a lot of other people waiting, Uma tells DR's foreign affairs podcast Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe two girls spent the next several hours in the small waiting room, where visits to the bathroom were accompanied by an officer who locked them in and followed them back in. No one was ready to answer what had happened and what was going to happen before the girls were called in for an interview, where they were asked in detail about their plans for volunteer work.\n\n\"It's only then that we realize we've made a mistake that will cost us entry into the United States,\" says Uma. By that time, the girls had been waiting for five hours, and a recurring theme was that they were not given any information about what had happened.\n\nThen came a discouraging message: Their intention to volunteer was not related to their so-called ESTA. That would require a work visa, which they did not have. Therefore, they had to leave the United States. And the girls' action in good faith would have even greater and more violent consequences.\n\n- We never in our wildest imagination thought we would end up in that situation, says Uma.\n\nAccording to the girls, no one from the WWOOF organization informed them that the volunteer work required a visa, and they had not found information about it anywhere else.\n\nChanged travel instructions\n\nAccording to the girls, they did not find information about volunteer work and special visas on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' website either.\n\nThis week, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs changed its travel guidance to specifically state that you cannot enter on ESTA \"if the purpose is education, work, or if you are going to run a business. This also applies to volunteer work.\"\n\nPreviously, it stated more generally that you could be denied entry or deported if you have \u201cstated a false purpose for your trip, have previously stayed in the United States for too long, or if you have previously been convicted in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed DR that the changes are being made because \"based on a number of citizen inquiries, we have seen a need to highlight and elaborate on parts of the travel guidance, including matters regarding entry and stay.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms that the two young Danes have been denied entry to the United States and that the ministry has provided consular assistance in the matter.\nHandcuffed and taken away\n\nFor Uma and Frida, there was no other option but to do as they were told by the American officers at the airport. Even though they offered to drop all plans, the intention to work on the farm was enough to trigger the ban on entry into the United States.\n\nBut it was only here that the agony began in earnest.\n\nThe next flight back to New Zealand didn't depart until three days later - and the waiting time had to be spent in detention, without personal belongings and zero access to the internet and the outside world.\n\nAfter about eight hours of waiting, countless questions, fingerprinting, mouth swabbing, photographing, and body searches, the girls were handcuffed and led through the airport to a police van with bars on the windows, which drove them to their temporary residence, the federal detention center in Honolulu.\n\n- When I saw Uma in handcuffs, I broke down, because seeing your travel companion and best friend in handcuffs is something I never thought I would see, says Frida.\n\nWhen meeting with the detention center, the same procedure is followed as at the airport and in addition, the girls have so-called mugshots taken.\n\n- One of the officers joked that I could use it for my Instagram, Uma remembers.\nCell 105\n\nIn the detention center, they are given underwear, socks, a t-shirt, a set of green clothes and plastic shoes.\n\n- It was like watching a prison in American movies and TV series. We were met by 25 women who we didn't know were real criminals. That's when we found out, both girls say, and continue describing:\n\n- It was a huge gray room on two floors with cells all around with numbers on them and then a metal table in the middle. We were given a cell with a metal bunk bed, where there was a closet and a toilet, but there was a window in the door so you could always see in there, even when you had to go to the toilet. And a tiny little window inside the cell - cell number 105.\n\nThe hours and days in the American detention center near the airport are slipping by for the two girls. The time is spent writing in a diary. Frida is doing puzzles. All the while without information about what will happen to them.\nDuring the three days the girls were in custody, they wrote a diary. (\u00a9 (c) private photo)\n\n\"We met a Belgian woman in there. She was the one who told us everything about how the prison worked and the rules in there,\" says Uma.\n\n- She had started writing a book on paper in there about how corrupt she thinks the prison system is. We both write diaries from home, so it was normal for us to get a lot of thoughts down on paper, says Frida.\n\nAfter three days with the Belgian woman and the other women in the detention center, the girls have a meeting with an American immigration lawyer, and for the first time they feel like they are actually getting some information about what is happening.\n\n- We suddenly felt on equal footing with someone. They were there to help us, and they could give us a lot of information about what had happened legally, and that our parents had booked a hotel in New Zealand the next day, so suddenly there was a certainty that we knew what to do. We had had no contact with our parents, so it was absolutely crazy, they say.\nMany arrests in Hawaii\n\nAlso earlier this year, there have been stories of other European citizens who have been denied entry to the country due to what is considered in the United States to be incorrect or suspicious entry grounds.\n\n    I believe the arrest and detention of Uma and her friend was likely the result of the Trump administration granting arrest quotas to every Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in the U.S.\n    Esther Sungeun Yoo, manager\n\nStill, a refugee and immigration lawyer from the University of Hawaii believes that this is unusually harsh treatment of the two women.\n\n- I believe that the arrest and detention of Uma and Frida was likely the result of the Trump administration giving arrest quotas to every Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in the United States, writes Esther Sungeun Yoo to DR.\n\nShe is the head of a legal service that has assisted the two young Danes and says that immigration lawyers in Honolulu have seen higher levels of arrests and detentions of travelers at the airport since the arrest quotas were introduced.\n\n- Some of the people we are now seeing arrested are not like those we saw before.\n\nOn the first day of his inauguration, on January 20, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that, among other things, orders maximum scrutiny and security checks of foreigners attempting to enter the United States.\n\n\nhttps://www-dr-dk.translate.goog/nyheder/udland/droemmerejsen-endte-som-mareridt-unge-danskere-naegtet-indrejse-og-faengslet-i-usa?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_hist=true",

I watch one of those airport border guard shows (This particular one follows customs officers in Spain and Australia) and one of the common themes is people attempting to enter the country for volunteer work. They're always sent back if they are trying to enter on a travel visa (or visa-free passport). So it comes as no surprise these girls met the same fate.\n\nAs to why there were sent to a prison: it's because they literally aren't allowed to enter the US and their flight back to New Zealand wasn't departing for 3 days. They're not going to let them live in the international airport terminal for 3 days, and they can't put them into a hotel because again, they're not allowed to enter the US. I agree it seems excessive, but unfortunately it's just shit luck they didn't have a flight back sooner. What's not clear is why they didn't just put them on the first flight back to an EU country...but maybe the girls insisted on New Zealand? The article doesn't state.\n\nBut in summary, I don't think this has anything to do with the Trump administration. This would have most likely played out the same way if they tried entering any other day this century.",

It\u2019s a global plan to destabilize democracies and install tech monarchies in their place. I started researching this by looking into Curtis Yarvin, Usenet, and Steve Bannon. A lot of people don\u2019t know this but Steve Bannon worked for Goldman Sachs and he ran a Chinese based Wow (yes, the video game) gold farming operation. There is a an article where he talks about harnessing his troll army - read children he co-opted into working for his political ends. This along with the \u201cNetwork State\u201d and \u201cpro-natalist\u201d movements are part of the same plan in my opinion.\n\nI would not be surprised to find that a number of these people found the \u201cKingdom of Germany\u201d through an online video game or something like 4chan. This  has been a slow burn, the people behind MAGA and Trump have been planning to do this for decades and they should be taken seriously. They have all been recruited from the worst of the internets depravity to work for this singular purpose. There is a reason they lack empathy, they were chosen because they don\u2019t care about the suffering they cause. The trolls are trying to take over.\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/18/steve-bannon-learned-harness-troll-army-world-warcraft/489713001/",

        "body": "Protests are just one of almost unlimited possible tactics that can be used in nonviolent civil resistance. If you use one tactic, then the regime will need to counter one tactic. If you have millions of people participating in diverse, coordinated tactics aiming to undermine support by converting supporters into dissidents, the regime will need to counter the scale of those activities. It seems pretty logical to me that, if our strength is in numbers, we should be using tactics that leverage that strength through coordinated mass action and by unleashing the sheer intelligence and creativity of the population.\n\nProtests are one of the highest risk tactics to use because they concentrate dissidents in small areas, reveal dissidents publicly, and require incredible stamina and mass outrage to run for long periods of time. It's easy for people to not see change, feel like there is no momentum, and start dropping off from participating. I'm also not convinced that protests really change the minds of supporters of the regime. It's easy for propaganda to undermine protests and cause them to backfire in developing support -- hence they are covered as \"riots\" or terrorists or just plain lunatics.\n\nDon't just take my word on it. I recommend you read \"The Checklist to End Tyranny\" by Peter Ackerman, founder of the International Center for Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC) -- a nonprofit awarded the Nobel Peace prize for their scholarship and education around nonviolent civil resistance. This book presents historical, statistical, and practical analysis of civil resistance movements around the world and distills the lessons learned into a series of questions that allow dissidents to evaluate how effective their campaign is likely to be and where they can improve.

This is something that protesters always have to keep in mind.\n\nWe actually really need the CIA ofold to collapse such regimes illegally clinging to life much faster. Unfortunately, the CIA is an American government institution that's currently under the power of a maniac who doesn't care about democracy, while the EU is too friendly to make such an undertaking. Ultimately, it's not fair that whenever democratization comes closer, such regimes simply weather through protests and/or downright repress all opposition, whereas established democracies sit while internal forces (often using external help) turn people towards autocratic beliefs.

We dont want current government and we dont want the opposition since they havent done anything in the same amount of time as government. Because students dont want violence, all protests have been peacefull and with insane honor and dignity of all people involved which our dictator hates, cause he constantly sents provocations to incite violence and paint protestors as some angry mob.\n\n\n2. EU doesnt want regime change in Serbia. \n\nThe current regime in Serbia gave EU everything they wanted.\n\n Every year or two the current president (dictator) signs new agreement with so called Kosovo that only hurts Serbia, slowly one by one he signs it. When you sign a deal with someone, if you give something, the other side should also give something in return. Well no. All the deals that our dictator signed was literally just Serbia giving things to Kosovo for no reason at all so they can further opress people in our south province. \n\nEU also needs lithium to combat China and their car manufacturing and other manufacturing. Germany has bigger lithium reserves, but they know those mines cause MASSIVE damage to ecology, they know german people would not agree, or any other EU country, so Serbia has to do it. That is why EU supports our dictator cause he doesnt care as long as EU helps him stay in power and both EU and dictators regime gets rich. They are literally beating people and threating their children to kill them in order for them to sell lands in Jadar region to Rio Tinto.\n\n\n3. All media is under control of regime. Every private owned telivision was bought by regime over the years and they are day and night targeting anyone who says even remotely something bad about anyone from regime. Older generations being that they dont even use internet are getting brainwashed for over a decade now with same rethoric. \n\n\n\n\n4. Final words.\n\n\nWell there you have it. The reason why protests are slow is because serbian people dont want to get labeled by regime and by EU as some angry mobs that simply want to go into revolution and we no longer want to let paid oppositon take the protests. All the protests are organized  ONLY by students at their democratic hearings at the universities and we the regular people follow and support our smart youth since they are the educated future of our country. They dont want violence and we the people support them. The biggest reason why these protests also are going slow is because EU has done LITERALLY nothing and for long time they tried to hide and ignore them. Serbia is on path to EU and as such, EU has great power that they can use to help people of Serbia. The reason they dont want to is Kosovo and Lithium. Why should they change the current dictatorship when the dictator gives them everything they want as long as they dont against him. In fact it was EU who funded the campaign of the dictator to get him to power in the first place. \n\n\n\nThat is the reason why protests are slow. EU basically supporting the dictator and students being smart, honorable and with dignity and not wanting violence between serbian people. But dont worry, we might have chosen longer and harder path, but we will prevail in our struggle for freedom.",

I would understand if they surrounded his residence and danced around it, maybe they would spoil his appetite that way. I think the concept of non-violent protest has been distorted lately. Because now it is a party, whereas in Gandhi's time it was an action of mass civil disobedience. Both now and then there was no violence on the part of the protesters, but in Gandhi's time there was at least a disregard and bycott for laws that most people disagreed with.",

I know that no ad could make me voluntarily spend my own money to vote for a Eurovision song. \n\nI think it's more that Yuval (the singer for Israel) had the most passionate fans. I lived in Israel for more than a decade but have lived in Europe for 5+ years and plan to stay here. Israel has always been very intense about Eurovision-- I think a win means a lot more to Israel than it does to most countries who just see it as a fun song contest.  Israel has always gravitated toward serious ballads that somehow tell the Israeli story-- for example one of my favorite entries was when Palestinian singer Mira Awad and Israeli singer Achinoam Nini sang \"There must be another way\" together in English, Arabic, and Hebrew. (This year the runner up in the contest to choose a Eurovision entry was actually an Israeli Arab.) To Israelis a vote always feels like \"the world cares about us, understands us,  and supports us,\" even though I think to most of the world it's not that deep. Israel almost never enters humorous songs so it was almost a shock to the Israeli mentality when Netta won a few years back with a fun banger-- I think Israel didn't know what to think! \n\nI've watched Eurovision for years on and off but never bothered to vote until last year. Living abroad, voting gave me a chance to show support for the Israeli people,  especially because we could see how much hate Eden was getting.  The song last year was originally entitled \"October Rain\" and basically told the story of how bereft we were feeling after the horror of Oct 7. Last year Israel was almost complete iced out by the judges,  which made it feel even more meaningful when the audience vote put Eden pretty high in the rankings. \n\nThis year I felt less intense about supporting Israel in the voting than I did last year (and actually split my votes between Israel and a bunch of other countries), but I was still reminding friends and family to vote for Yuval and spent my own money to vote for only the second time ever. This singer was a survivor of the Nova massacre who literally had to hide under dead bodies for hours on Oct. 7. She seems like such a sweet, warm soul and her song told the story of this resilience. It is also objectively a really good song sung beautifully.  I've been listening to it on repeat since it came out (though maybe I'm not a great judge of what would objectively do well in Eurovision bc I also voted for Switzerland and the UK-- and in my opinion Estonia should have won,  we gave him multiple votes). \n\nI also breathed a huge sigh of relief when Israel didn't win-- honestly nobody needs the drama of Israel hosting Eurovision right now!! I just wanted to support Yuval and see her finish well,  like Eden last year.  \n\nAnother factor is that for obvious reasons a LOT more Israelis moved out of the country to Europe since Oct 7. One secret to doing well in Eurovision seems to be to have something so awful happen in your country that a lot of your people leave and become potential Eurovision votes.  :-p Voters in the country where I live gave our 12 points to Ukraine, because we have a ton of Ukrainian refugees here.  \n\nTl;dr I don't think there is really anything deeper going on here than that Israeli fans were really motivated to get out the vote and show support. Call YOUR friends and family to vote for your favorites next year!",

It all happened during a show broadcast on Russian television.\n\nOne of the guests stated that \"the events that took place in Bucharest showed that nothing can be done with them peacefully.\"\n\n\"What can be done with such European leadership? Unfortunately, the events that took place in Bucharest have shown that nothing can be done with them peacefully. The guys have completely compromised themselves. Liberal democracy has achieved a new victory.\n\n\"Not in the sense that the mayor of Bucharest was declared the winner, not in that sense, but in the sense that they have perfected the techniques to stay in power under any circumstances,\" said the guest on the set, during a show broadcast on Russian television.\n\n\n\nNicu\u0219or Dan won the 2025 Romanian presidential election . The independent candidate obtained 53.60% of the vote, while his opponent had 46.40%. Nicu\u0219or Dan's victory was commented on at the Kremlin on Monday.\n\nOn May 19, Dimitri Peskov said about the election of Nicu\u0219or Dan as president of Romania that it was \"strange at the very least\", as reported by the Russian news agency TASS .\n\n\"We know the story of the candidate who had the best chances, who, without bothering to find any justification, was simply forcibly removed from the race. And in the absence of such a favourite candidate, whoever won won. This is the reality,\" the Kremlin spokesman said.\n\nIn April of this year, just weeks before the Romanian presidential election, it was revealed that Russia was modifying AI and Wikipedia with pro-Kremlin propaganda. With a very well-established network, developed over the past three years, they were modifying the content of Wikipedia articles, as well as data provided by artificial intelligence, with pro-Moscow messages.",
