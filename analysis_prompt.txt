**Title:** On this day 80 years ago, Adolf Hitler killed himself
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 83570
**Comments (200):**
  1. Editor:


"Get me the biggest typeface we have"


"Bigger!"


"I SAID BIGGER!!"
  2. The man who killed Hitler.
  3. 12 years too late at that point.
  4. A good day it was. So should be the fate of all tyrants and dictators and those who want to emulate them.
  5. If only other, present-day dictators would follow suit in honour of the anniversary...
  7. The only good thing he did in his entire life.
  8. 80 years later and there again are people who should be taking an example by what Hitler did on the day of his death.
  10. He was a coward, to scared to face the consequenses of his own actions
  11. I wish THIS kind of history would repeat itself
  12. Hitler dood. Wat nou?
  13. Sic semper tyrannis ü§üüèª
  14. He took poison AND used a Gun. If anything, he wanted to make damn sure he didn't fall into Stalin's Hands. He was terrified of the Bolsheviks.
  15. The best thing he ever did. If only some could take example.
  16. Those who idolize him today should follow him and do the same.
  17. I suppose it's too much to hope for a repeat of history?
  18. I wish Donald could read as he likes to emulate powerful leaders.
  19. He died 56 years too late
  20. He did what no one else could. Take out Hitler.
  21. His greatest idea by far
  23. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  24. Imagine living through 4 years of war and seeing that headline

Edit: Yes, my counting skills are exceptional :)
  27. Good riddance. He should have done it years earlier.
  28. Rest in Piss you won't be missed
  29. There are still at least two more to go.
  30. One can always hope...
  31. And what did the world learn from WW2? Nothing.
  32. He was the most competent Hitler assassin of all time.
  33. Today is a day to enjoy
  34. Legit the only time it's good to celebrate suicide.
  35. I like that the title took the entire half of the page
  36.  But did he though? Or did he end up in Argentina?
  37. Best thing he ever did.
  39. It's funny that so many people these days look up to a man who ended up cowering in a bunker, off his mind on drugs and power, and had to take his own life because his plan failed.

What a great role model! 

And that's ignoring all the heinous shit he did. Just purely from a "successful ruler" perspective, he wasn't one. His Autarky economic plan required conquest (and free labor via slavery of political prisoners, Jews, Romanis etc.) to keep going as the debt incurred by military spending was huge.
  40. What a great day
  41. Good
  43. This should be holiday
  44. And he killed poor Blondi first. :(
  45. Adolf Hitler attempted to kill Adolf Hitler and fortunately the attempt was successful, even though he died in the process.

At least he did one good thing in his life.
  46. There were an estimated 42 assassination plots against this coked-up wanker, which only goes to prove: if you want the job done right, you have to do it yourself.
  47. There is no proof that he died there. Story has it that he escaped to Argentina and died of an old man
  48. A major day in world history. What would have happened if he didn't khs? Would the Russians or Allies have taken him prisoner and/or worse?
  49. I didn't even know he was sick
  51. Trump has the opportunity to do the funniest posible thing
  52. Say what you want about him but he did kill Hitler.
  54. Instead of facing the consequences of his actions. He chose the easy way out. Such a coward. Just like his followers.
  55. May luck be a lady tonight.
  56. ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

The best fascist is a dead one.
  57. oh so he actually did something good?!
  58. A day worthy of celebration, finally
  59. And a good day it was.
  61. Also George Washington became President on this day 236 years ago
  62. Some Argentinian communities beg to differ but ok.
  64. MAGA day of mourning I'm sure.¬†
  65. Trump has the chance to do the funniest thing ever today‚Ä¶..
  66. This should be an international holiday
  67. How long weve to wait Till we read same about putin üíú
  68. Easiest upvote of the day.
  69. Man who killed Hitler found dead.
  70. Churchill with the hot take‚Ä¶.
  71. On this day of great memories, I‚Äôd like to remind everyone that every Nazi has this choice, and should follow in their leaders footsteps expeditiously.
  72. I heard that he fled to Argentina, became a member of the Rothschild family, and had a son named Donald.
  73. I love Americans invaded the comments with their political shit.

go to your own subs (or preferably - outside) to whine üôÑ
  74. Hitler "killed" himself.
  75. He was too scared to be in court. Fuck him!
  76. I can't really wrap my head around how an uneducated failed artist got to the point where he could dictate huge societal and military operations. Like. Could no one involved see that it was a huge fuck up?
  77. The only good thing he ever did the bad thing is that he didn't do it sooner.
  78. The only bad part about this is that the fucker wasn't tortured to death.
  79. He died?? Why am I always the last one to find these things out on reddit of all places?
  80. He should do it again
  81. HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
  82. When and how was it released that he killed himself?¬† The German announcement is clearly avoiding the national shame and defeat of admitting it was suicide.
  83. Was it really 80 years ago. In some ways a long time & in others only yesterday. With his passing ended a fashion trend never to be seen again - the weird little moustache thingy.... ü•∏
  84. Today is my birthday yikes

We are NOT reincarnating hitler with this one üî•üò≠
  86. The best thing Hitler ever did
  87. Throws every able-bodied German man and boy into the meat-grinder of the Red Army while he cowers in fear in mein bunker and checks out.
  88. I wonder what I can saying about that without Reddit suspending me for "glorifying violence" again?
  89. Fake News.
  90. Long may he rot in hell!
  91. Some times bad news are good news.
  92. Pussy
  93. Daily Mail wipes away a tear.
  94. Can we get a reenactment in the states?
  95. current fuhrer - take note.
  96. Now its time for other dictator to follow steps of his idol
  97. Europe and the world waiting for the next big headline
  98. TIL Hitler killed himself on my birthday.
  99. More modern wannabe-nazis should follow his example.
  100. To think he‚Äôd executed others that tried killing him, then he turns around and does it himself!
  101. Ironically, NETANYAHU DEAD, would probably be the contemporary equivalent.
  102. Waiting for putin
  103. Except that he didn't. He faked it and moved to Argentina. He even had kids. At least that's what the U.S. and Argentine governments believe.
  104. Didn't the CIA release info saying he escaped to South America?
  105. He didn‚Äôt kill himself, he went to Argentina check the cia documents
  106. Hitler died of old age in Argentina
  107. Debatable
  108. He lived his whole life in Argentina
  109. Momentous. May his contemporaries follow suit
  110. TRUMP DEAD


COMING TO A HEADLINE NEAR YOU
  111. American here:

I'd love a re-enactment
  112. The irony... A man who had united most of Europe, driven to a suicide by a bloody communist dictator. :(
  113. Rip bozo
  114. Keep him dead.
  115. And now we're waiting for "PUTIN DEAD" headline! ;)
  116. That truly was Hitler‚Äôs best painting.
  117. Surprised that Cheeto didn't mention this today.
  118. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  119. Putin, take note.
  120. ...orrrr did he?
  122. Certain leaders are crying on this day
  123. The only thing he did worthy of praise
  124. Maybe history will repeat itself?  We can only hope.
  125. such a pussy
  126. Ragequitted when the Soviet tanks were already in his backyard.
  127. Can't wait for the Trump and Putin pages
  128. Nice shootin' son
  129. So the field released by Argentina were fake?
  130. Imagine if a Mango fell from a tree today.
  131. He killed himself...and then the bigfoot.
  132. The man. The legend.
The absolute madlad who ended Hitler. 
A hero.
  133. Wow that long ago? Feels like just yesterday we were watching a fascist leader stripping human rights away. Oh wait..
  134. And then his soul wandered the world for 7 years in search of a new victim. "Vladimir, STOP!!!" became it.
  135. normal door gray light aware pocket groovy strong truck gaze

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*
  137. Should have been Man of the Year for this heroic act of service to humanity
  138. Can‚Äôt wait to read the Headline "PUTIN DEAD" same asshole, different time.
  139. RIP to the goat
  140. I wonder what would've changed historically if he didn't at that point. I assume there would've been a public execution after the nuremberg trials, and somewhat better understanding of how dictatorships work, but what else? A breakdown in court would've been pretty sweet but unlikely
  141. I didn‚Äôt even know he was sick.
  142. The guy who chose the font size had been waiting for this moment for 12 years
  143. Putler is the next. üíÄüôè
  144. One of my favourite jokes:

Say what you like about Hitler, but he was the man who killed Hitler.
  145. he was never right. coward.
  146. To bad orange goblin doesn't copy him.
  147. I could name 5 ppl that should follow suit.
  148. With luck the next will be Putin üçÄü§û
  149. May all other tyrants and dictators quickly enjoy the same fate.
  150. Please, history. Repeat yourself.
  151. Happy hitler death anniversary (also my birthday)
  152. Happy dead despot day! Here's to many more!
  153. Thank God the countries of this world learned their lesson and will never again allow an insane dictator to hijack their freedoms.  Phew.
  154. people say hitler never did anything good, but look at that: the mad lad killed hitler.
  155. His followers should emulate and reenact
  156. Mussolini was executed on Saturday, then Hitler killed himself on Monday. Not a bad couple of days.
  157. On this day, 30 years ago, exactly 50 years after this event, I was born, yikes
  158. ah....someday, we too can celebrate
  159. Now all we need to kill are his redneck horcruxes.
  160. Pussy
  161. If we're  lucky  maybe  another  wanna be dictator  will  copy  him today
  162. A good nazi is a dead one¬†
  163. "*Or so the Germans would have us believe*" - Norm
  164. I‚Äôm Canadian, and as you know, Trump keeps blathering on about making our country the ‚Äú51st state‚Äù.   
&nbsp;   
I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of the old joke about an old Jewish zaide saying to Hitler, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to die on a Jewish holiday,‚Äù and Hitler says ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù.  The zaide says, ‚ÄúMister, any day you die on will be a Jewish holiday.‚Äù   
&nbsp;   
Not that I would wish death on anyone, but, as Mark Twain is reported to have said, ‚ÄúI have read some obituaries with great pleasure.‚Äù  I expect that will be the case for many of us, where Trump is concerned.   
&nbsp;
  165. Hitler saw how Mussolini‚Äôs corpse was disgraced, his body drug through the streets Stripped naked and hung on a girder. Hitler shot himself and had instructed a minion to have his body burned.
(Brittanica source)
  166. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  167. That‚Äôs what they want us to believe.
  168. Based ngl
  169. Linguo‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶. dead
  170. LETS GOOOOOO
  171. Trump is in mourning for his idol
  172. what a shame his son is running the US right now. who knows, maybe we‚Äôll get a father-like-son ending too
  173. And then he was reborn just over a year later‚Ä¶
  174. History has a chance to do the funniest thing rn
  175. Looking forward to history repeating itself.
  176. Trump has 24 hours to do the right thing. Granted vance should drink the koolaide as well
  177. Republicans in the US: üò•üò•üíîüíîüò≠üò≠
  178. Fingers crossed
  179. One day we will wake up to his obituary
  180. Take a hint Donaldo!!!
  181. Can't wait for the reincarnation to die too
  182. Trump should be more like his hero.  Skip to the end, please.
  183. just hoping I live long enough to see a similar headline.  Dude‚Äôs hella old, I like my chances.
  184. Good.
  185. GOOD!
  186. Like a coward. Like every fascist coward faced with personal danger. They run or get bone spurs.
  187. May all dictators and tyrants have the same fate.
  188. If only dump would do the same
  189. Could we have a repeat of our hiltler wannabe?
  190. Say what you want about Hitler but at least h√© did kill Hitler.
  191. Say what you want about Hitler but at least h√© did kill Hitler.
  192. Yay!
  193. There's only one good kind of Nazi...
  194. only suicide i'm happy didn't fail
  195. Fingers crossed for a new headline like this!
  196. We will celebrate just as hard when the current slate of authoritarians are taken out, by their hand or the peoples.
  197. Watch the brilliant movie Der Untergang to see how everything went down.  Bruno Ganz is fantastic as Hitler.
  198. And apparently has been reincarnated
  199. "Hitler dood. Wat nou?"
  200. Cool of them to put the picture of the guy who killed Hitler on the front page!

**Comments (144):**
  1. ‚ÄúLook, can your JD Vance go visit Putin for a minute too?‚Äù
  2. It‚Äôs funny. Trump‚Äôs body language and mannerisms seem much more engaged and ready to listen when he isn‚Äôt acting up to television cameras.
  3. It was at that point Zelenskyy pulled a deck of cards from his pocket and said "Xi told me you might need these."
  4. Quick someone chuck Holy water over the mango bellend, we have to be sure
  5. Imagine being forced to keep sucking up to this Guy. Zelensky really goes above and beyond for his country
  6. The world of 2025 in one picture. 

I understand less and less of it. But will go and hug a tree now and look for some birds and flowers. And hope for the best.
  7. Is it just me or is the framing of this photo really bizarre? I can't imagine the sequence of events that would lead the two of them to drag two chairs face to face in what looks like the middle of a square.
  8. It is a funeral, why isn‚Äôt he wearing a black suit? Doesn‚Äôt Trump own a black suit. The disrespect.
  9. Zelensky is a freaking hero of historical proportions for keeping his shit together facing Trump. His country is on the line, yes, but that guy is a wolverine. Total respect.
  10. One is a traitor and one is trying to save his country from an aggressor in Putin
  11. Trumps side profile got him looking like a blob fish out of water
  12. Trump looks exactly like the bully he is
  13. Volodymyr, you‚Äôre doing a great job, but you don‚Äôt know anything, especially about deals. Nobody knows more about deals than I do, believe me. Listen, this is a beautiful place, very classy, a lot of people-but I‚Äôve done much bigger, much better events in my casinos, no offense! You need me,  I could fix this whole thing in a week, maybe even faster. Some people are saying three days. Tremendous results, the best results, nobody else could do it
  14. "Why don't you wear a black suite?"
  15. Trump looks like a fat toad.
  16. Zelenskyy vs the Antichrist: Battle of the Vatican.
  17. Zelensky sitting on the edge of the seat, as usual.

Because he needs to hang those big balls of steel.
  18. What a weird picture
  19. I remember seeing a betting site offering the "Zelensky wears a suit in his next meeting with Trump". This was the less likely option.¬†
  20. waste of time... mostly because trump is set on humiliating zelensky
  21. It was very touching to hear the applause as Zelensky entered. It would be exactly what the Pope would have wanted.¬†
  22. Zelenskyy knows what we know: all talks with this US administration about a peace agreement or about the US providing security for Ukraine are a waste of time because Trump is Putin's mvp.
  23. Trump in blue..

Disrespectful
  24. [So good that Zelensky got a huge round of spontaneous applause when he appeared on the steps later.](https://imgur.com/a/612Vq8U)
  25. The amount of dictators this poor guy has to deal with...
  26. Zelenskyy is Jewish and still a better Christian than Trump.
  27. You can feel the tension even through the photo
  28. What a nice arena for a boss fight.
  29. The fact that Zelenskyy has to deal with this asshole on any level makes me ill. There‚Äôs only one Democratic President in this picture. And only one man.

He‚Äôs on the right side.
  30. The sinner and the saint
  31. Trump's sitting like he's on the shitter...oh, that's right...
  32. The leader of the free world meets the US President.
  33. A great man and a poisonous orange rat
  34. "you wore a suit for him and not for ME???".
  35. It looks like Zelensky is hearing Trump's confession, which we all know isn't the case. Not from a man who has now started arresting judges who defy his lawbreaking.
  36. This picture made by Vai≈°vilaite, Lithuanian ambasador in Vatican üáªüá¶
  37. One of them hardly speaks English and the other is Ukrainian so I wonder how that conversation went.
  38. Some really interesting body language from both of them. Both are leaning in towards each other which shows both are actively interested in what each other is saying.   
  
Zelenskyy: Has both feet firmly planted with feet pointing either direction of Trump. His hands are open palms as if he is explaining something to Trump.

Trump: Hands are clenched together with feet tucked under chair which may indicate some uneasiness on his behalf however him leaning forward towards Zelenskyy shows genuine interest in what Zelenskyy is saying.

Body language would suggest neither of them want to be in that conversation, but both have to be. Hopefully something constructive comes from that conversation.

Also I guess this 'chance meeting' is why there was so much extra security for the popes funeral.
  39. A giant and the world‚Äôs tiniest man.
  40. Looks like he‚Äôs still going on about the cards
  41. I hate that Zelensky has to lower himself to deal with this ignorant slob.
How humiliating.
  42. Zelensky: I need the guns, the artillery the support to fight and save my people. 

Trump: I asked in my tweet, Vladimir STOP. Now say Thank You.
  43. Oh my god can anything anywhere in the world be free of this man‚Äôs bullshit. Ban trump from all public international events he‚Äôs a fucking parasite.
  44. How‚Äôs trump not on fire??? üî•
  45. I didn‚Äôt think felons can travel out of the US?
  46. And the bishop moves diagonally away
  47. Trump is telling him he is about to declare himself the new pope as nobody knows more about poping than him
  48. I hope Zelensky gets to live out the rest of his days in a peaceful cottage surrounded by the ones he loves when this is all over. He deserves nothing but the best. He has sacrificed so much to lead his country through this war.
  49. Oh here‚Äôs the fool showing up to a FUNERAL at the Vatican in a blue suit!  Talk about having no respect! What a horrid man.
  50. Zelensky is such a strong leader, imagine being that close to trump and not smashing him in the face‚Ä¶
  51. Trump is the enemy of the free world. Zelenskyy is its champion.
  52. Neither of them.is Catholic, right? Kinda crazy that they'd talk in the Vatican of all places, given how their relationship has been going so far. Looks like the Catholic Church still has a lot of soft power. Not that trump would understand that.
  53. I am an atheist. But‚Ä¶. Maybe we can get one little lightning bolt here?
  54. So much respect for President Z. That man is the real deal.
  55. Good for you Trump for looking like you‚Äôre really deeply listening to him when we all know nothing is going to come of this‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll just turn around and blame Ukraine
  56. Trump looks like he‚Äôs been poured into that suit.  I wonder if he has any genuine ability to honestly hear/listen to what Zelinsky has to say.
  57. Finally and good picture
  58. Trump dosent even wear a black suit...well dosent surprise at all
  59. Trump: "I got a really good deal for you to end this war. But you'll just have to wire transfer me $20 million Joe Biden gave you."

Zelenskyy: "You are a showman, you couldn't even run your casinos."
  60. Zelensky must know, everything Trump touches dies.
  61. Trump accuses Ukraine of starting the war. How can Z even listen to a second of his rambling.
  62. And only one of them is wearing an appropriate outfit.
  63. When the devil and a hero meet at the Vatican.
  64. Zelenskyy looks like the disappointed teacher trying to get trough to the asshole bully he‚Äôs trying to redeem
  65. I'm anyone is interested, we have a lip_readers transcript of the conversation. Will publish soon
  66. With all of his wealth, Trump did have a black suit for the funeral of the Pope?
  67. If I was able bodied I would join the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. I am a disabled veteran and I‚Äôm ashamed of my president, I would rather die fighting for a country actually fighting Russian aggression. Then die by the hands of my government for simply having my views. They‚Äôre already going after our judges, I‚Äôm certain at some point my VA benefits will be taken away, it‚Äôs only a matter of time after that imprisonment. That‚Äôs how serious I am taken what is going on in America and not just rhetoric.
  68. Least someone had the sense not to let JD Ponce tag along.
  69. The position of the feet tells me everything I need to know.
  70. Trump must be mad Z put a.suit on for this and not for him.
  71. This is such an odd picture. Why would you want to sit in front of an orange blurting nonsense
  72. Only one is there respectfully for the pope. Suited appropriately in black for mourning
  73. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  74. Watch ‚ÄúFrom Russia with Lev‚Äù.  Very interesting.
  75. Imagine having to deal with this buffon
  76. Does Trump even own a black suit?
  77. Without the cameras, his officals, and yes men (read: J D Vance) around him, he cannot just shout, bully, terrorise, or act all bigly. Trump is an utter pathetic piece of shit.
  78. At least Zelenski wants to talk to him. Xi on the other hand, still no picking up his phone.
  79. Even in death Pope Francis was able to join this two, with a body language not really seen before.
  80. ‚ÄúGreat, totally awesome meeting..some things were said‚Ä¶I pretended to listen‚Ä¶I‚Äôm great at that by the way‚Ä¶the best‚Ä¶we may, possibly see some amazing things, I dont know‚Ä¶we‚Äôre only here because Biden killed the Pope‚Ä¶but we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶this isnt my war anyway‚Ä¶i just got here‚Ä¶we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶.‚Äù
  81. The devil has many tricks, the best of which is to convince man that an orangutan is not the antichrist.
  82. It‚Äôs quite disgusting that Trump is having this impromptu meeting at St Peters. No respect for the sanctity of the church or the fact that the pope just died.
  83. Damn Trump so ugly and fat
  84. Zelensky:¬†"You think flattering a war criminal makes you strong? It makes you weak. We need action, not ego. Get your shit together, or history will remember you stood with dictators, do you want that legacy?"

Trump:¬†"‚Ä¶Nobody talks to me like that."

Zelensky:¬†"Then be someone worth respecting."
  85. Politics aside, this picture goes hard
  86. Trump has a great posture. The greatest.
  87. What is so controversial about helping a country that was getting shelled over Easter (while the Pope died talking to JD Vance about compassion), doesn‚Äôt seem very ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù to me to leave the Ukrainians to Putin‚Äôs carnage
  88. I‚Äôm gonna say it - it sounds pathetic but I‚Äôm gonna say it - if you check where Trumps ankle is, he‚Äôs definitely got lifts in those shoes. üë†
  89. He has a message from Xi. The phone's not gonna ring.
  90. Has he said ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to the monsignors yet though?
  91. Zelenskyy, please say no to the idiot. Krim is Ukraine üí™
  92. Trump is telling him to just hand over some of his country.

I hope Zelensky is asking him if he would hand over an invaded state in the US to stop a war.
  93. If he doesn‚Äôt have a black suit it is acceptable but black is the colour of mourning.
  94. I'm genuinely curious why Zelensky even bothers talking to him. Hopium? Trying to appease the baby so he doesn't send troops to help Russia?

It's glaringly obvious that Drumpf doesn't want a deal where the US actually has to help Ukraine. And it's obvious that Drumpf will not negotiate in anything but bad-faith. And even if they signed a deal, Drumpf would honor it as well as Putin honors his agreements.
  95. Trump looks so polite and reserved here. That's what happens when you wont be able to bully a man at war and you're not surrounded by sycophants who'll bully the same man with you.
  96. Trump is so fat
  97. Thats a weird place for a stare contest
  98. Trump dressed inappropriately for a funeral in a blue suit. I hope Zelensky told him off!
  99. huh he didn't burst into flame. Score 1 for atheism I guess.
  100. Couldn‚Äôt Trump wear black for a funeral? Doesn‚Äôt he have any respect ?
  101. Why the hell is his hair transparent? For gods sake I can see the mango outline of his weird, egg-shaped head.
  102. Life is getting to the point in which it's difficult to tell if something is AI or not these days.
  103. Poor guy, gotta sit there and listen to the dribble coming out of that orange buffoon.
  104. Has this man not suffered enough!?
  105. Trump confessing his sins üôÉ
  106. Strength to Ukraine, heroes of Europe
  107. I‚Äôm surprised the place didn‚Äôt set fire when he walked in. They‚Äôll have to cleanse everything in holy water after Trump leaves.
  108. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the deal: you give Putin one half and I get the other half‚Äù.
  109. Look at his sitting posture, I mean who sits like that??? And don't get me started on his heels in his shoes. What's the deal with those??
  110. This was set up by Macron

This is Macron's last or one of the last attempts with Trump before it gets dirty and hot with EU involvement. (General bomb was a pre-threat).

Ukraine hasn't gotten dirty yet with European involvement.

Let's hope but don't hold your breath. Trump has frontal lobe dementia, a host of other degenerative cognitive problems including addiction to uppers, and is literally a compromised agent of the Kremlin...
  111. Why is Zelenskyy talking to that stupid old fickle orange snowflake man? Waste of time.
  112. Trump sets foot in the Vatican, immediately bursts into flames.
  113. One real leader and one 34 time felon.
  114. Says a lot that he wore a suit for the pope and not for Trump.
  115. ‚ÄúHello Mr President‚Äù

‚ÄúHello guy I blackmailed into finding dirt on Joe Biden or I wouldn‚Äôt give Ukraine any Hellfire missiles *which caused me to get my second impeachment*‚Äù
  116. ‚Äú you know people are saying‚Ä¶ I should be the next pope. I would be a great I mean people told me ‚Äú Mr. President, you would make a great pope‚Äù but you know I‚Äôm not Catholic. I said and they said ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok You‚Äôd make a greatPope!‚Äù I said we‚Äôll see but I must save Russia I mean Ukraine first‚Äù
  117. Nice view of Trumps high heels
  118. Trump really thinks  he can get a Nobel.Peace prize brokering a one-sided deal..
  119. WARNING;A deal with a 34 conviction,convicted felon an expert in lying, extortion,blackmailing will not end well.period.
  120. I am so ashamed that our country voted this idiot into office again.  Can‚Äôt fix stupid
  121. Bless Zelenskys heart. Why does he keep trying with this brain-dead toddler? Any heart to heart they have here will be forgotten as soon as Trump is back around his puppet masters.
  122. The hunchback and the warlord..
  123. Selenskyi ist ein Held. Trump ist ein Arsch. So einfach ist das.
  124. At least Zelensky was respectful enough to wear black to a funeral.
Trump never fails to hit new lows.
  125. Zelensky deserves Nobel Peace Prize for not attacking Trump.
  126. I hope Zelenskyy tells him to piss off
  127. Even at a funeral, Trump is trying to find a way to fuck someone.
  128. So, Donny boy isn't aware that he should be wearing black?
  129. Trump has such a weak posture
  130. Zelenskyy is someone, real. None of this phoney wanna bee, wishing I was, thinking I am. He‚Äôs in the moment everyday working toward a better future for his people, we could use more like him.
  131. What? Trump doesn‚Äôt have a black suit? Does he even own a black suit? He doesn‚Äôt behave respectfully in the pope‚Äôs funeral.
  132. It's be so worth it if Zelenskyy straight just slapped him one
  133. So he‚Äôs just trying to get Ukraine to give up its land to Russia and call that a peace deal ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂
  134. wtf is this happening at the Pope's funeral?
  135. That kyphosis coming in strong, can't wait for a nursing home admission in the next 6 months
  136. Really?  At a funeral?
  137. One of these men eats cheeseburgers and calls everyone idiots and the other fights for ALL of his people.
  138. ‚ÄúDo you even own a black suit?‚Äù Is the only thing Zelensky should have said.
  139. At least Zelensky wore black
  140. ‚ÄúPlease please please end the war, I look so bad right now, please just end the war and give Vlad what he wants, please, I‚Äôm desperate!‚Äù
  141. Rumors saying that Trump is having second thoughts about his relationship with Putin.  Let hope he sees that and reverse all of his shit, but I doubt it.  I hope he gets impeached soon.
  142. Zelenskyy is extremely brave, I'd hate to image the smell coming from that diaper wearing sex offender.
  143. Hopefully, they did have a productive chat, it's high time for pple to settle down and align for the benefit of the world,
  144. Why didn't it get media exposure this time?

**Title:** Czechia renamed streets and places surrounding the Russian embassy
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 65912
**Comments (200):**
  1. The embassy's address is Ukrainian Heroes Street, 36. They see that in their mail every day.üòÅ
  2. Apparently this is old news, but I only learned about it today. Lol.
  3. First time I heard about it.

Savage üòÇ
  4. The map is also missing that the bridge over the railway track in the Ukrainian heroes street is named after Vitalii Skakun who blew up the bridge in Henichesk at the beginning of the invasion.
  5. Similarly the street next to russian embassy in Warsaw was renamed "victims' of russian aggression street" - 
ul. Ofiar rosyjskiej agresji
  6. what were the previous street names?
  7. Orb√°n wanted to build a Chinese university in Budapest, mayor renamed the streets around it Dalai Lama street, Free Hongkong street, Uyghur Martyrs street.
  8. How come Czechia is so based whereas Slovakia is so cringe?
  9. Another reason to visit r/prague
  10. Czechia had the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever and they did.
  11. Well Russia conducted a terrorist attack on Czechia few years ago so trolling the embassy address is the least they could do.
  12. In Warsaw they painted SLAVA UKRAINI on the sidewalk across the street from the Russian Embassy
  13. In Stockholm the Russian embassys street adress was changed to Fria Ukrainas plats. Translates to Free Ukraines place.
  14. Based
  15. Russian Embarassy.
  16. This is exactly what we did in Tirana after the invasion started. The road where the Russian Embassy in Albania is located is not called ‚ÄúUkraina e Lir√´‚Äù= ‚ÄúFree Ukraine‚Äù
  17. Meanwhile in Germany:

‚ÄûThe two Berliners who parked a destroyed Russian tank in front of the Russian embassy in Berlin at the end of February are to pay a fee of 806 euros. The Mitte district office sent the organizers, Enno Lenze and Wieland Giebel, an invoice for the amount - for the special use of a good 43 square meters of street space.‚Äú
  18. We did the same thing in Warsaw. We named the street the russian embassy is located on the "Victims of Russian Agression avenue"
  19. Poltikovskaya's "[Putin's Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putin%27s_Russia)" should be mandatory in high schools all across Europe.

Everybody should read it. It's a really thin piece of work, you'll read it in about a week or less, but it's so damn' accurate and spot on.
  20. if you wanna mail anything to Russian embassy you need to write Ukrainian heroes street, which is so beautiful
  21. fun fact - should the Russians who admire those ever come to power, it won't be an offending the embassy anymore but will be nice commemorates. win-win.
  22. 3 out of 4 streets are named after Russians üòÇ
  23. In Riga, Latvia the embassy is on Ukrainian independence street. For a year we fought ruZZian bots that changed it on maps back to the original name.

Gulf of Mexico they managed to rename in mere weeks. Muppets in Google.
  25. This should be done at every Russian embassy
  26. Renaming your capital's streets after Russian politicians to...own the russians?
  27. There is no reason to keep russian embassies in the EU.

Ps. I am Czech.
  28. Russian opposition isn't pro-Ukrainian. Different sort of imperialists, but still russian imperialists.

Want a really quality trolling? Name a street after Dzhokhar Dudayev. Promote people from ethnicities russia colonized and is now erasing disproportionally sending them to fight their imperialistic wars.
  29. In Bratislava they also renamed the street to Boris Nemtsov
  30. Nemtsov and Politkovskaya were decent people. Navalnyi was just another moskovian imperialist.
  31. Krakow did similar thing after full-scale invasion   
(they named park in front of embassy, as Park of Ukraine's Freedom)  
Proof: [https://tvn24.pl/krakow/krakow-skwer-wolnej-ukrainy-juz-jest-obok-miesci-sie-konsulat-rosji-st5785786](https://tvn24.pl/krakow/krakow-skwer-wolnej-ukrainy-juz-jest-obok-miesci-sie-konsulat-rosji-st5785786)
  32. The Czech people have a great sense of civil disobedience, especially when it comes to Russians and street names.

In 1968, as the Warsaw Pact armies invaded Prague, the citizens quickly defaced, removed, swapped, and flipped upside down all the street signs and address numbers across the city, causing mass confusion amongst the invaders unfamiliar with the labyrinthine streets.
  33. With the amount of crimes russia commits, pretty soon Prague will run out of places to rename.
  34. And that's about as much harm as the Czechs can do to Russia...
  35. Oh noes how will Russia ever recover from this
  36. ??Zelenskys Way??
  37. Never change, Praha
  38. potuzhno
  39. Lol thats funny because thats the best they can do...
  40. Out of everyone they could've named it after, why the racist bitch Navalny that has literally called Georgians cockroaches istg some people dickride him just because he's against Putin so much
  41. Square?
  42. In Canada our Russian embassy is on Free Ukraine street c:
  43. Spends millions to do nothing üòÜ
  44. We're naming streets after villains because of other villains.
  45. Excellent üëå
  46. It's beautiful
  47. They should do the same outside the Hungarian embassy.¬† 1956 uprising Street!¬†
  48. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  49. navalny was anti-putin, but was a ruzzian nationalist who didnt want to return crimea btw, dont honor him too much, he was a mini putin
  50. Take that Putin üò≠
  51. Legends
  52. In albania the streer where the russian embassy is located is called "Free Ukraine"
  53. We did a little trolling
  54. Not even the first such instance The communist party headquarters is on the "street of political prisoners".
  55. I wish we did the same thing here in Denmark.
  56. we did this a couple years back then russia closed it embassy

we changed the street where the embassy was to "Free Ukraine"
  57. Reminds me that th√© street the russian embassy lies on in Warsaw is named "Victims of the russian agression"
  58. Damn that's based!
  59. Well this is their city. They can do with there street whatever they want.
  60. We should be doing this at all Russian embassy and consulates around the world.
  61. "What is your address?"

"We have a helipad on the roof"
  62. This is Trolling level - legendary
  63. W, waiting for this to happen in Poland
  64. The Russian embassy in Dublin is on Orwell Rd.  Should be changed to Orwellian Rd
  65. Haha, and all the russians now laugh with these eu idiots!
  66. Renaming costs money. Czech taxpayers will pay for this, not Russia. I hope they will be happy that their government is wasting their money on boolsheet.
  67. That'll get them!
  68. I wish European reaction was stronger than renaming streets
  69. I'm sure Russia don't give a fvck about it.
  70. that‚Äôll show them
  71. Cool move,love it üòÅ
  72. Wow, that really showed them who‚Äôs the boss
  73. Vienna should do the same, would piss off all the spies at least
  74. I'm sure Russia is very impressed /s
  75. Good move
  76. Next level trolling.

Although it shouldn't be funny considering fate of those people

  80. üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üá®üáø
  81. There is also Bridge of Vitalii Skakun near the Ukrainian Heroes Street
  82. That showed them!!!
  83. The address of the russian embassy in Lithuania is "Ukrainian Heroes street 2"
  84. The bus stop close to the Russian embassy in Stockholm got renamed "Fria Ukrainas Plats", Free Ukraine Place" and there is a Ukrainian flag on a flag pole on the opposite side of the street. 

And every Monday at 12, M√•ndagsr√∂relsen (Monday Movement) gathers at Norrmalmstorg to protest against the war. Originally 1990-91 it was for the freedom of the Baltic states but it got a second wind after the invasion.
  85. Russian embassy staff are panicking right now "We're surrounded!!!" ;)
  86. The embassy in Latvia is in "Ukrainian Independence Street"
  87. Very funny! But I still believe ALL Russian ambassy should be ban in the west, they clearly don't want to speak so they should fuck off
  88. Good to see that Anna is not forgotten.
  89. This will surely help Ukrainian soldiers who are dying from lack of eu aid
  90. Czechia just built a geopolitical meme in real life
  91. That is an admirable level of petty.
  92. Every single person in "Ukrainian heroes" bundle did way more to fight Putin than Russians with personal street maes. Ukrainians spilled their blood and history will save them as unnamed heroes, sidekicks to three Russians who will be seen as some leaders of anti Putin resistance.¬†
  93. Nice lol
  94. waiting for the "putin is a lil bitch" avenue
  95. Sadly both alexei and boris were imperialists. Hard to say if they would have been better or worse than putin. navalny would have definitely be more dangerous as he wanted russia to be more efficient, yet still an empire.

  98. Luv it
  99. DC did the same thing in maybe 2018 or so
  100. Just like how the British embassy in Iran is on Bobby sands street
  101. Now fly a bunch of pride flags from the buildings around embassy
  102. Putin Street? Zelenskyy Avenue?
  103. This is awesome. Need more stuff like this.
  104. Ha haaa‚Ä¶ good!!
  105. Not all heroes wear capes ‚Äî some simply rename streets.
  106. And the portapotty in the back is called the Pootin
  107. Lol
  108. Not hardcore enough imho. I suggest to replace Navalny Outlook with Bandera Outlook. That's beyond torture for them
  109. Beautiful. I didn‚Äôt know.
  110. I have a feeling this is not going to end well.
  111. **Piss Off Putin Street** sound even better.
  112. Well done Czech
  113. Bravo! üëè
  114. such impressive

@

much help
  115. Reminds me of how the (former) leftist government in Calcutta renamed the street on which the U.S. Consulate sat to Ho Chi Minh Sarani--this was during the height of the Vietnam War.
  116. They all sound better than the Gulf of America.
  117. The pettiness is PERFECT. Love it!
  118. Like a boss!
  119. Lmao W Czech.
  120. Same name in Lithuania lol 

‚ÄúRussian Embassy, update your business cards: Ukrainian Heroes Street 2. I help you with the translation: –£–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –ì–µ—Ä–æ–µ–≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã 2,‚Äù the mayor wrote on Facebook.

‚ÄúFrom now on, a business card of every Russian Embassy employee will have to honour Ukrainian heroes. And everyone who writes a letter to the embassy will have to think about the victims of Russian aggression and heroes of Ukraine,‚Äù he added.
  121. Lol
  122. ‚Ä¶ just get rid of the embassy? Lmao this is embarrassing
  123. The war is over.  There is no way Russia can take that kind of blow.
  124. LMAO this has to be the best trolling Ive seen in a long time
  125. Trolling becoming part of politics is fun and strange
  126. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
  127. Oh my god, this is so deliciously petty. I love it.
  128. Israel, the United States, Turkey, and Azerbaijan all deserve the same treatment.
  129. Omg, will Russia ever recover from this...
  130. Love it. Wish we did the same or something similar with our Russian embassy.
  131. Didn‚Äôt Scotland do something similar with the South African consulate years ago during apartheid?
  132. Ukrainian Heroes Street?  There's everything but a Fuck Russia Avenue.  Guess that one died in the planning committee.
  133. Putin must be spinning now!!
  134. This goes hard
  135. Glasgow did this during apartheid renaming the location of the South African embassy in Scotland as Nelson Mandela Place
  136. Europe is trying not to be edgy and try-hard challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
  137. Absolutely based.
  138. they should erect a giant dildo inflatable right outside of the russky embassy :)
  139. I must remind you that czechs has prodused weapons for Wehrmacht  even when Berlin fell
  140. oh ya that‚Äôll really show em
  141. The bridge at one end of Ukrainian Heroes was just renamed in honour of a Vitalii Skakun, a Ukrainian sapper who cast away his own life to blow up a bridge in the opening days of the escalation.
  142. Putin Huilo!! more ruSSian embassies around the world should have the same, literally tens of thousands of names to chose from.  ruSSian embassy in DC on Bucha Massacre Rd.  Or Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin st.  Or Ukrainian Crimea Ave.
  143. Russia has been defeated.
  144. In Prague, there is a neighborhood called Vr≈°ovice. It's known as a working-class artsy district, though now gentrifying (looking at you Krymska!), with a distinctly anarchic, ≈†vejkish culture even by Czech standards.

Across the northern border runs Ruska, or "Russia Street."

Within a week of the escalation, some lovely person printed out great big stickers that perfectly covered the official street signs. Very high-quality stuff, indistinguishable from the real thing.

Ruska was unofficially, but comprehensively, renamed to Rusk√° V√°leƒçn√° Loƒè, Jdi Se Do Prdele.
  145. Hungary did the same with the Chinese :D
  146. Yes!
  147. Nice, Prague did a Fudan university streets.
  148. i didn't understand a single thing but is not a problem
  149. In Berlin, pedestrians were forced to walk down the middle of the Unter der Linden avenue for months due to the blocking of the sidewalk in front of the Russian embassy. As a result, many pedestrians risked their safety by walking in the bus and bicycle lanes. Eventually, measures were taken to close the lane for pedestrian use and implement additional signage.
  150. Amazing
  151. Damn.  Nicely done.
  152. This helped to stop the war, thank you.
Btw: czechia doesn't issue visas to russians
  153. They should make a ‚Äòfuck Putin‚Äô street
  154. Looking forward to visiting "Fuck-off-Russia Avenue"
  155. Throw good shade ü§åü§å
  156. russian embassy, as massive as always, gotta have enough room for the facilities for spies and saboteurs
  157. There was a south African embassy in Glasgow Scotland, the local council changed the street name to Nelson Mandela Place. True story
  158. Based
  159.  Used to live nearby. I don‚Äôt know about now but a year ago, there would always be an exhibition right outside‚Äîeither Russian burnt equipment from battlefield in  Ukraine or sculpture of a peace sign with Ukrainian flag nail polish‚Äî just another reason to love Prague. –°–ª–∞–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ!
  160. The American Consulate in Calicut is on Ho Chi Minh Street. Totally savage.
  161. In 1986, the street where the South African consulate was based in Glasgow was renamed to Nelson Mandela Place. The name remains the same to this day.
  162. I love Chechs. And they are the best neighbors.
  163. Never seen an entire country "fall" from a hotel window. Should be something else.
  164. Goooood!
  165. Varlƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± Rus devletine bor√ßlu slav bir halk i√ßin ilgin√ß bir tavƒ±r

  167. Bruh
  168. This is amazing
  169. Hilarious!
  170. That's great. Thank you.
  171. That‚Äôs so damn cool!
  172. That‚Äôs unbelievably petty, and I‚Äôm all here for it.üòé
  173. Czechenia
  174. So basically  
U.S. Embassy (Pre-2003), Palestine Street, Green Zone, Baghdad, Iraq

^(The story is simple: during the 1967 war with Israel, the Iraqi government renamed the streets where the old U.S. embassy buildings were located. As a result, the U.S. government was forced to use 'Palestine Street' in its address until the Kuwait War.)
  175. There were many things I liked about Czechia. Now there is +1 to that list.
  176. People remember what you‚Äôve done, be it good or bad.
  177. At least somebody has Europe‚Äôs back
  178. Lol
  179. Great. Now I'm wondering what's the street name for the Austrian embassy.
  180. If true this is fucking based
  181. Cool to know that this is the only sanctions they could afford.¬†
  182. Based

Hungary once did something similar around the Chinese embassy, naming a street after the Tiananmen massacre or something similar IIRC

Unthinkable nowadays
  183. I have a lot of respect for CZ. They have balls to stick to their principles. For example, when everybody around them adopted the Euro, they stuck to their Crowns even though they met the convergence criteria.
  184. Edinburgh did the same to the South African embassy. They renamed the square where it‚Äôs located Nelson Mandela Sq. so his name showed on all their mail.

Kudos to Czechia too.
  185. petty and pathetic.
  186. For every Prague there is definitely Slovakia ,transitinia,Hungary ,India to swing it the other way
  187. This is some new level of shithousery
  188. Another reason why Prague is my favorite city
  189. # Czech Streets?
  190. The kind of petty trolling I support no matter who does it on who
  191. Amazing!

Did they do a similar thing in London?
  192. Based
  193. Oh wow, happy to see that Europe still supports us, even in psychological warfare
  194. This is all I needed to see to accept the new names of those streets and locations. Update all my maps. 

But that other thing is still the Gulf of Mexico.
  195. Based
  196. Reminds me of a Story about the Apartheit South African consultate in Scotland. The square where it was located was renamed "Nelson Mandela Square"
  197. Peremogha
  198. Why's boris' square a triangle?
  199. Very beautiful place
  200. Hahaha, there is the street of Donbass heroes in Moscow near by the American embassy.
Checkmate 
PS. The street was called when invasion just had begun.

**Title:** Greenland signs lucrative minerals deal with Europe in blow to Trump
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 65971
**Comments (165):**
  1. Either Trump will now say that Greenland is not important for minerals, they're not very good, he never wanted Greenland anyway, and only losers trade with them, and we already have a beautiful deal, the best deal with Ukraine for our cherished minerals

Or

He will throw a massive tantrum, wave around 5000% tariffs on Greenland, threaten invasion, cut off shipping lanes, direct all military bases there to be closed, say Putin can have Greenland if he wants it, and blame Ukraine for all of this

What he won't do is: behave like a moderately well-adjusted adult
  2. The all-caps incoherent tirade is going to be delicious.
  3. All caps threat to Europe incoming from the man child. 

Going to be brilliant. He really is doing a lot of winning at the moment lol.
  4. Sorry, Trump, but this is real life. 


The European gets the girl.

  6. breaking news: orange man turns red with anger
  7. By Brendan Cole - Senior News Reporter: 

Greenland has allowed a Danish-French consortium to mine a rock which is key to the production of aluminum.

The permit granted to Greenland Anorthosite Mining (GAM) to extract anorthosite follows interest in the Arctic territory from U.S. President Donald Trump in acquiring the island.

GAM, which is backed by French company Jean Boulle Group and real estate investment firms bodies from Denmark and Greenland, was granted a 30-year permit, Reuters reported.

  13. The absolute torpedoing of the United States's foreign relations over the last six months is something that will be studied for decades. 

Openly accepting obvious bribes from a country he called a sponsor of terrorism last term, loudly stating he wants to take over other countries like they're neighboring buildings, refusing to help poorer countries that can't pay it back, siding with the aggressor in a war because helping the defending nation cost money, acting like a trade deficit means the entire world is ripping the country off, not honoring any past alliances to insult and attack allies, taking all the credit for "winning" both world wars, ambushing leaders for the sake of a TV moment, and acting like the biggest reason why the United States should run the world is that it's just that great.

Trump represents the most toxic part of the American ego in all the worst ways, giving no respect but expecting nothing but that from everyone else. China has been handed the biggest foreign policy win by simply offering business and help while not antagonizing the entire world, and I don't think anyone in the Trump administration realizes that.
  14. That's how you make a minerals deal.

  34. Nice
  35. Leave him screaming in a room all by himself like the petulant child he is.
  36. Tronald and DJ can go suck a bag of dicks
  37. Finally we will mine Greenland's deep substrate foliated kalkite
  38. No one wants to deal with am unstable psychopath.

The rest of the world should shun the US
  39. 130 km south of Nuuk. Deal is made on the promise of protecting the environment from negative effects of resource extraction. 

The company must present a detailed plan for the future mining activities by 31. Dec 26. Including cooperation with the local communities. Jobs. Education. infrastructure investments. 

AND how to stop the mining activities (Clean up. Giving site back to nature. No pollution)

If the company does not meet the Greenlandic administrations expectations or the mining operation has not started by 31. Dec. 2028, there is no deal.
  40. Unrelated, but Newsweek really is just an ad pop up nightmare these days. Video ads automatically playing, multiple pop ups, ads all throughout the article. What a mess.
  41. Art of the deal!
  42. A major win for freedom and democracy.
  43. The art of the deal.
  44. This was just noise, like everything else to drown out the real objective, dictatorship in the US. Everything else is just noise, while the Supreme Court dismantles your government. Nobody sees or talks about that. People concentrate on the noise.
  45. Good for you Greenland! Elbows up!
  46. Good! Fuck Drumpf
  47. Yes!
  48. The golden Trump touch in action again.
  49. good.
  50. Hahahahaha suck that lemon !! Gonna need a MAGA conference to blame it on Biden
  51. He's going to call it an act of aggression and treason. Bet.
  52. Nothing better than news that hurts the orange
  53. The orange twat is going to be foaming off his foul smelling mouth once he knows about this.
  54. Trump and so many Americans thought they could play hardball with the entire world and win. Then the world just goes on without them. Sad!

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION IN THIS MATTER!
  55. What page of ‚ÄúThe Art of the Deal‚Äù do I need to refer to for this situation?
  56. Art of the (helping someone else make a) Deal
  57. As an American, I‚Äôm now actively rooting against the United States. Great job, Greenland. üòé
  58. "This Is The Way"
  59. correct me if im wrong, but wasnt the main point of taking greenland to control the northern side of the sea and make sure china / russia dont?
  60. That orange faced lunatic cannot fathom how being an utter bully and making insane, inflammatory statements might push business and political/strategic partners away.  He truly is as unintelligent as people say.
  61. Bracing for Truth Social meltdown in 3... 2... 1...
  62. As an American, thank god.
  63. Hahahahahahahahaha. Republicans are creepy loosers.
  64. Trilions of Euros worth of deal! This is historical deal! Once in a lifetime opportunity for EU and Greenland. This will create jobs all around the union and make us all rich. EUROPE IS GREAT!
  65. Well that backfired quite nicely. The end result of competent stupidity.
  66. Good, long may this mutually beneficial deal with Europe and Greenland continue.


No need for scaremongering, no threats, no random hypothetical statements from a delusional old man. Just good international business deals the ways it's supposed to happen.
  67. He‚Äôs gonna go ape-shit
  68. He'll take credit for it. It's the 5D chess he's been playing y'all!! Hail king orange turd.
  69. Greenland is important to the US/NATO for maritime navigation with the emerging Arctic shipping routes.

Minerals are a side quest at best.
  70. Anything that is a middle finger to orange guy makes me happy
  71. GOOD
  72. Trump the best president of EU lmao
  73. This is what Ukraine should do, it's abundantly clear by this point Trump isn't going to force Putin to make peace with Ukraine but is going to demand Ukraine still give the Trump foundation its resources after he walks away. Ukraine should give Trump the middle finger and offer resource rights to other countries and tell Trump that if he wants Ukrainian resources they will not be given to Trump to pay off an imaginary debt to him but will be in exchange for money Ukraine can use to buy weapons with
  74. As an American I find this hilarious. üòÇ Good for Europe. Now we can‚Äôt just walk in there and take everything.
  75. Now Trump will REALLY want Greenland.
  76. "Greenland? Never heard of him" - Trump, probably.
  77. Lol
  78. Now if only the same happened with Ukraine
  79. Not a glowing endorsement for ‚ÄúArt of the Deal‚Äù. You‚Äôll find better negotiating tactics scrolling through your LinkedIn feed.
  80. This made my day.
  81. GOOD.
  82. Good!

Fuck America

Fuck Trump

Fuck Americans
  83. One can only wonder if, maybe, just maybe, Trump's approach to the Greenland issue might have put Greenland off the idea of making a deal with Trump.

Art of the deal, indeed.
  84. American here. Headline had me in the first half. I was all, "no, no, no, no" until I saw Europe, then I giggled with satisfaction. Thank you Greenland for not kowtowing to the man baby pretending to be the President.
  85. This won't please the Orange Hitler.
  86. As a US Citizen, that's great to hear. My fellow Americans swimming in a tide of ignorance must learn the hard way.

Still, I can't help but feel that Putin is pleased as his biggest foe is sabotaged from within, into utter isolationism.
  87. Europe first
  88. Trump: Art of the Deal üòÇ
  89. You‚Äôll get tired of winning!
  90. Be clear.... this isn't a blow to Trump. It's a blow to America, its international relationships, technology, infrastructure, businesses, jobs and citizens.
  91. The truth is, as an American, I still think this is the right move given how Trump doesn‚Äôt understand how to engage with other relevant global players that have long been our Allies.
  92. Way to go, Greenland. Just gave trump a stage 9 burn.
  93. Good.
  94. They are under Danish law.
They get good deal via Europe 

Considering taxes and the threat of tariffs.
Why would anyone work with USA anymore.
Let it go to purge for a few years.
The Maga can either kill the Antifa or vice versa.
Don't care anymore.
Just want this 2 party play acting to end
  95. Canadians will meet Trump at the border with hockey sticks and rocks if we have to. Patriotism is STRONG here. Never seen anything like it in my lifetime. Elbows up Canada. It‚Äôs up to us. And good on ya Greenland.
  96. Afammokk
  97. Good for them, secure yourself from bullies by community. Power with teamwork.
  98. Duh
  99. Now Trump must occupy Europe. Luckily he has a friend who will be happy to help him.
  100. Haha
  101. As an American this news is ::chefs kiss::
  102. Hahahah.  Bravo!
  103. As an American from birth, WELL DONE GREENLAND! üá¨üá±
  104. A big FU to Trumpty Dumpty. Well-deserved
  105. Good.
  106. Art of the deal
  107. It's almost like being a dick in international relations can backfire.
  108. Hahahaha!!
  109. Lolol
  110. Hilarious
  111. He fucked around and found out. This is one of many deals moving forward. You want to be an absolute isolationist monster that ambushes heads of state while allowing their citizens to be murdered, then you and your country will suffer. The interesting part is the majority of his supporters that voted for him earn less than $30k a year and will be paying more taxes and way more at the grocery and way more at Walmart thanks to him giving tax breaks to billionaires and putting tariffs on countries that make the majority of things they buy. And their rapist leader doesn‚Äôt give two flying fucks about the suffering of normal people that work hard for a living‚Ä¶ 

they also fucked around with their racism, homophobia and anti immigrant beliefs, and now they are going to find out. I hope they like the low wage jobs they are going to get shoveling shit at dairy farms do less pay when all of the jobs they have go bye-bye because other countries tax our products and won‚Äôt want them anymore because of our racist piece of shit leader made this happen.
  112. Awesome news for those countries. Fuck Trump
  113. Thanks Trump for fucking over our country time and time again. Shit head.
  114. Why is Europe blowing trump?
  115. As an American, what a fool
  116. Did everyone else notice that Greenland isn't hot anymore ever since I said I HATE GREENLAND?

- Donald Trump (probably)
  117. I am really enjoying all the shit the USA is getting and they bloody deserve it.
  118. not great news, the indigenous people and the land will still suffer from the extraction of materials. doesn't feel like a true victory.
  119. He will deny Greenland exists now and that he doesn't know 'them'.
  120. Greenland is in Denmark. Denmark is in Europe. A Danish - French company is investing in Denmark.

What part of that is incorrect? How would this be news anywhere outside Trump's presidency?
  121. Now the orange shit gibbon is gonna go harder after Canada.
  122. I thought Greenland was a strategic resource because of its rare earth metals(lithium etc) why  mine a pristine environment for a common/abundant metal like aluminium? The bottle necks for aluminium production is the high electricity demand for refinement of the ore not ore supply. Greenland should use proceeds from rare earth mining into a sovereign wealth fund like Norway does.
  123. Aluminium? And that's win? At lest something like Copper!
  124. Rekt.
  125. So now the same people fighting climate change are celebrating a mineral deal that will directly negatively effect the climate

Everyone here is a hypocrite
  126. Start drilling now!!

Btw, use profits for the welfare of Greenlanders and for military protection/autonomy
  127. muahahahahaha
  128. get fucked donald
  129. What a stupid headline.¬† They signed an agreement with a private company that happened to be based in Europe to mine stuff.¬†¬†


Might be sell the results to Europe, might sell it to the US. Who knows.¬†¬†
  130. Correct me if I'm wrong but American corporations could and still can mine anything there, right? So is this a blow because of increased competition? Article mentions aluminium.
  131. Hahaha üòÑ.  Can't imagine why
  132. As an American, I say, "Ha ha. Good."
  133. ‚ÄúGreenland?  Never heard of him.‚Äù
  134. Sweet
  135. What about Amaroq? Basically anyone can mine there.
  136. ArT oF tHe DeAl
  137. For mining an aluminum ore?   k.
  138. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Fuckin' stick it to 'em.
  139. LOL.  Yes.
  140. Good. Fuck Trump.
  141. Welcome Greenland!
  142. This is good. Just a small example of the fuck America attitude permeating the world these days.
  143. \#TheArtoftheDeal
  144. Love this
  145. We need more morkite.
  146. Hahahahahaha
  147. Hes going to put tariffs on Greenland minerals to Europe.. thatll learn em.
  148. lol
  149. Anyone knows why we did not make a giant mineral deal with Ukraine similarly cementing cooperation?
  150. That might explain the sharp rise in Amaroq minerals share prices yesterday.
  151. Trump is the best thing to ever happen to Europe
  152. Trumper tantrum incoming.
  153. Wait for the truth social meltdown.  Thank you Greenland!
  154. Smart!
  155. SO MUCH WINNING üèÜ
  156. I love that for them
  157. Great! We should reduce any liabilities with the US as much as we can.
  158. Canada, Trump only wants our rare minerals. We can make excellent deals with other countries!
  159. Spite is a bitch.
  160. Gas Lighting time.
  161. Nice to start the day with some good news for once.
  162. Greenland unfortunately needs to ensure its future as the ice melts and its mineral deposits become more accessible. Let‚Äôs face it what‚Äôs they the US wants their land. It‚Äôs got ports and road networks to access these minerals as they become accessible.

Can‚Äôt say I envy Greenlands position. They‚Äôll profit greatly if they can make lucrative agreements but as a small populated nation it puts them as risk of aggression from those looking to access the resources.
  163. Oh, weird, I thought Greenland would love to deal with us after meeting Vance. Huh.
  164. You love to see it
  165. It's been interesting to see Trump's D-people turn on a dime. They never gave a hoot about Greenland except to deny climate change. Now they started claiming we need to steal it for the sake of national security because the shipping lanes are opening up due to....

nobody knows why the shipping lanes are opening up. Climate change doesn't exist. But we need to steal Greenland anyway.

**Title:** Zelensky posing for a photo with Ukrainian cleaning ladies working in the Czech parliament
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 60222
**Comments (200):**
  1. More context:

"I saw them leaving, moved and crying, and that moment moved me too.

The first photo from President Zelenskyy's visit to the Chamber of Deputies and a powerful human moment. Volodymyr Zelenskyy's team invited the Ukrainian cleaning women for a photo together when he noticed them watching his visit from an adjacent room through the glass. The Ukrainian president made time in his busy schedule for his compatriots who work in the Czech Republic and represent his country. Different from him, yet significant."

by [Olga Richterov√°](https://x.com/olgarichterova/status/1919340661544726912)
  2. Look at that smooth smile of his
  3. They are utterly smitten (I would be too)! ‚ù§Ô∏è
  4. I got a lot of respect for this dude.
  5. Normal and cool people, slava ukraina
  6. If Trump and Putin lived 10,000 lifetimes they could still never be half the leader this man is.
  7. Find you a president you want to look at like that woman looks at her president
  8. Dude is as real as it gets. Proper leader, proper human.
  9. The most significant leader of our time. Prove me wrong.
  10. This man will be talked about in history books. A brave leader.
  11. I really hope that when the war ends he will be able to get back to a happy life. The dream would be having him as a future President of the EU commission, but i fear Ukraine won't be able to join for a long time unless the EU grows a spine and realize that Ukraine deserve its place and a preferential lane just for merits of war alone.
  12. I hope this man gets to live a long happy life in a free Ukraine.
  13. That's a true leader!
  14. He is probably polite and respectful towards them. Everyone counts and contributes. Trump wouldn't even be in the same room as a cleaning crew, they're slaves,  and parasites to him. This is the embarrassment we have running our country.
  15. Trump would rather jump off his mansion, then do something with common people.
  16. Legend
  17. If we have a hero nowadays, here he is!
  18. I really wish we‚Äôd send out a new Voyager ‚Äú2‚Äù probe, except instead of Da Vinci‚Äôs scribbles on what humanity looks like we just put an image of Zelenskyy playing the piano with his knob because he is the fucking human of all humans.¬†
  19. I'm not gay, but Zelenskyy is a good looking man.
  20. Respect. The current world doesn't deserve a guy like that.
  21. As an American, im very envious of Ukraine's leadership.  I wish my country was smart enough to know better.
  22. that's cute cause he looks appreciative of the flattery directed his way, which shows he is not the ungrateful person some portray, but instead sincerely touched by support and hasnt yet got the big head where you just expect it all blas√© (like so many...)  
He stays honest
  23. Putin doesn't like to be touched, and would NEVER pose with the common rabble like this. Zelensky, in contrast, is a decent human being.
  24. let's be real they have a big crush on him - We all do.
  25. Still not wearing a suit. /s

You earn respect by your actions, and this man has earned all of it.
  26. Living Legend
  27. <3 this picture!
  28. What a legend
  29. the ladies are glowing, lovely picture
  30. Slava Ukriane!
  31. He's just a chill dude in an unchill world.
  32. See, THAT is a real man and a true leader!¬†
  33. Look at those babies that hold all the glory and money, while this man is humbling himself to the weakest
  34. Ugh the president envy is REAL üò≠ FDT
  35. They love him!!üíñüíñüíñüíñ
  36. By whatever scale you want to use, Zelensky is an absolutely amazing human being. 

Ukraine could not possibly have made a better choice when they elected this guy.
  37. And he looks at them with genuine affection, something Trump would be completely incapable of doing!
  38. There's the "Man of the People", and then there's just a man-of-the-people. And right when I thought I couldn't think more of him. It is my wish that history remember this man kindly.
  39. He's a literal man of the people.
  40. Man of the people. Salt of the earth.
  41. Ugh the president envy is REAL üò≠ FDT
  42. Living Legend
  43. He's a true human. For those who stuggle to understand: he is not an antihuman.
  44. It is impossible to not admire him. Wow.
  45. That's a real leader right there, with actual integrity!
  46. Love that man!!! Slava Ukraine
  47. In the Czech republic the backbone of cleaning, nursing and kitchen staff are made of Ukrainian women.
  48. God bless you mr. PresidentüëçüíØüá∫üá¶‚ô•Ô∏è
  49. That's the smile of a leader who loves his people!¬†
  50. May Zelensky crush his enemies, see them driven before him, and hear the lamentation of the women.
  51. –°–ª–∞–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ! üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶
  52. Dude's smooth AF.
  53. Legend üî•
  54. can't remember a single time a president took a press photo with the staff
  55. ‚ÄúIt was nonsense‚Ä¶I hold ALL the cards‚Äù
  56. Quite the ladies man! That‚Äôs why Putin is jealous with his weenie-peenie!!!
  57. A day they will never forget
  58. Trump hates him because Melania and Ivanka look at him like that but never have him.
  59. A small gesture with a huge impact
  60. Those ladies are loving it.
  61. Now compare other western leaders, any leader. Not a single one can reach his kindness, closeness to the people. And not even in his dreams Putin could stand so close to his people.
  62. Ukraine president was one of the biggest Ukrainian celebrities before taking office. He know how to turn the charm on at command lol 

Good will prevail againts trump
  63. look, i dont know all the history, and please, assume that i'm brazilian, and i really dont know about this to make a side of this shit, but look, this man need to be a pround of himself

a man that come from comedy and shows, with no experience about international relations, war finance, and alot more another things, and he continues steadfastly, day after day, with mental and physical attacks, to him and his country, to defend her people

I don't think even Russia expected so much resilience

i can be alot wrong, and sorry if i'm ....
  64. Now that is my vision of a true leader.
  65. he is a true human being, this is why they are fighting and why we need to back them.

they and he is one of us. fuck anyone that says otherwise
  66. The GOAT
  67. Czech Republic may as well be Ukraine Lite at this point, there's so many of them here. And I don't think many Czech people mind because they really, really dislike Russians lol
  68. A man of the people!
  69. Now this is a leader
  70. There are tens of thousands of displaced Ukrainian people across eastern and central Europe... There were Ukrainian maids in almost every hotel when I was in Czechia. This was touching, thanks for posting!
  71. Man of the people!!!! Fuck yes!!! What an absolute G. Leaders around the world wish they were as cool as Z.
  72. Whatever one thinks of his decisions (I have nothing but praise myself but not well informed on specifics), but no one can deny the man has the charisma of a God.
  73. Love this mutherfucker
  74. OMG can you imagine trump with the cleaning ladies working in  Mar-a-Lago
  75. Swoon. Haha
  76. Now let's do Trump talking with clean ladies.
  77. He at least could have worn a suit. ü¶Ü+ üèÉ
  78. This is what a leader looks like. Not like the fat fuck in the white house who would want to deport the cleaning ladies to a third world country instead of making Ukraine safe for them to work in their own country because he is too busy kissing Putin's ass.
  79. Out of every leader he‚Äôs one I personally want to meet one day.
  80. Thats how Melania looked at Trudeau
  81. Leader of leaders.... the man aged so hard. Can we vote him as president of the EU please...
  82. That man is a true hero and a true leader.
  83. Only a little guy, but he stands tall! Great leader.
  84. Give that man all the prizes already!
  85. Now THAT is a President
  86. He‚Äôs the best. The world needs more Zelenskys.
  88. I want to take a picture with Zelensky. üòû
  89. And now image pitin doing the same thing?
  90. Wow and we have Mr Burns now :( (üá©üá™)
  91. Hero.
  92. Now that is a real leader!
  93. That is effing beautiful. This guy just can‚Äôt help but be awesome.
  94. Pure class üëèüèªüëçüèª
  95. A man who loves his people.
  96. There is not a lot of people especially high officials that would stop for ‚Äûmere cleaners‚Äú . Much respect to him. I think he does the a man of the Folks thing the right way.
  97. I feel like this is exactly how I would act around him, couldn't help it!
ü´†
  98. This is a wonderful photo. ‚ù§Ô∏è
  99. Love this photo
  100. That‚Äôs my kind of president. So impressed with his integrity and compassion.
  101. The lady in the left is really Czeching him out....üòÅ
  102. This man is a true leader, honest, a patriot, defender of his country unlike Trump a liar and a criminal
  103. A man of the people. Good going! Just a normal person.
  104. Reminds me of the photo of Obama fist bumping someone at the white house. It also felt genuine. 

Could you imagine Trump doing a photo session with the cleaning staff? Would never happen, and if it did it would be so cringeworthy.
  105. That is beneath Chump and his master Cutin
  106. I love this guy so much
  107. Probably 20 seconds of his (I imagine limited) time...

For a generational legacy of "did I ever tell you about the time I/my mum/my grandmum/etc met the bravest man in the world"...
  108. That‚Äôs a real leader. 
I can‚Äôt wait until Trump is gone.
  109. What a horrible, horrible person. 

JK. 

Trump is a bitch. And Zelensky is for and of the people.
  110. He‚Äôs a good man, but he also has some very media-smart people working with him.

Nothing wrong with that. üòá
  111. I understand why Trump, and Putin want him gone. He is a menace...
  112. Love that guy.
  113. I wonder if he‚Äôs wearing a bullet proof vest. Doesn‚Äôt look like it
  114. A real leader.
  115. Totally spies Blonde version
  116. I like these lady‚Äôs. No falseness in their faces
  117. As a Ukrainian, I haven‚Äôt forgotten many of Zelensky‚Äôs missteps‚Äîlike downsizing the army before the war or his promises that we‚Äôd defeat the Russians by May and be grilling shashlik in Crimea. Nevertheless, I think he‚Äôs handling things much better than I expected. And lately, I‚Äôve become much more loyal to him because he and our diplomats are withstanding Trump‚Äôs insane pressure and even managing to steer his ridiculous, crazy proposals toward something halfway acceptable.
  118. Imagine T doing that
  119. –°–ª—É–≥–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É
  120. They look like they're so proud of him.
  121. I love this man
  122. He is the closest thing this century has to a real leader.
  123. Zelensky is an amazing man.  I have mad respect for him.
  124. Here in Ukraine we are forced to fight and there is a forced mobilization of civilians, why does the whole world not care about human rights in Ukraine?
  125. Volodymir, stop it mister Rizz, hold your horses üòÅ
  126. How many humans in the comment section? Looks like bots upvoting bots
  127. The hero we needü•π
  128. similar level of education they have
  129. Wow he is the prettiest of them all
  130. Quality leader. Care about everyone.
  131. What a leader should be.
  132. If space aliens attack I am voting for him the world leader!
  133. Big Z showing what real leadership looks like these days.
  134. Dementia Donnie should take note Zelensky is a real Leader and Man!
  135. Looking her right in the eye with a sincere, warm smile.  As an American, it makes me envious to see a country led by someone so genuine.
  136. Putin will fall. Soon.
  137. Zelensky is such a decent man.
  138. It is not cleaning ladies. It is Ukranian Spice Girls re-united
  139. I like his new black jacket. Looks very good on him. May the force be with him¬†
  140. Hey I think I've seen this Czech movie before
  141. His wife better watch out. :D
  142. The man has class.
  143. That one woman is snuggled in there pretty tight. ü§£
  144. I thought they were wearing hooters uniforms at first glance
  145. Can confirm, where I work in Czechia we also have Ukrainian cleaning ladies, also the production line workers are mostly Ukrainian ladies.
  146. Imagine Trump posing for a photo with "the help".
  147. Did he say thank you though???
  148. If you saw Trump posing with the White House cleaning staff, would you find it endearing or staged?
  149. Trump: they hate his guts, 5% approval rating!
  150. lol take this pick away! It just reminds me of how painfully awkward the Cheeto and his cronies are around the unwashed masses.
  151. I'm an American on vacation in the US, we arrived in Prague yesterday and learned Zelensky did as well. So cool! 

Walked by the Prague castle today and saw a military drill as well as the Czech president. He seems like a pretty good dude.

I hope you all in Europe are proud of your country and leaders.
  152. I hope they get a decent pay Czech.
  153. Trump would never allow himself to be in the same room as custodial staff.
  154. Love this so much

  197. The guy just gets better and better.. and he's quite cute which helps.
  198. My instinct was to think this was staged somehow or just for positive press. Something in me refuses to shake that feeling but the more I read the comments the more genuine it seems, so that's probably just me being paranoid.

  1. Finally some good news!
  2. I'm so happy for you guys and the whole Europe üá∑üá¥üá™üá∫ I hope one day we'll also be able defeat our POS ruling party.
  3. Nice avg IQ boost for the EU leadership.

Congrats Romania!
  4. I heard that Chad has a new president who is from the Balkans. Is that correct?

Balkans just can't stop winning üí™üí™
  5. My President!!!!
  6. This whole period between the cancelled election and today has been a nightmare for me. I no longer have to ask myself how could I keep living in a country where most people choose someone like simion to be their president. I am finally relieved. 
Long live Europe. 
üá™üá∫üá∑üá¥
  7. A double gold medalist at the International Mathematical Olympiad, a Sorbonne PhD, a respected mathematics researcher, the mayor of our capital, and undeniably a genius. Thank you moldovans brothers and fellow romanians. I could never live in a world that rejects such a man for a populist, jobless monkey full of hatred.  it's DAN and dusted. üá™üá∫üá∑üá¥
  8. Congrats Romania! üá≠üá∫ü§ùüèªüá∑üá¥ We will follow your lead in 2026 and will imprison Orban and the Fidesz
  9. Beautiful sight!
  10. Relieved, congrats to Romania!!
  11. It's Simiover. Happy to be one of 545 people in my heavily rw area in Italy to put the stamp on Nicusor.
  12. And another loss for Putin! So happy for the Romanian people. He seems like a great leader.
  13. Hundreds of people in the streets in front of the headquarters as well. They were chanting Nicusor's name, singing the national anthem, "Europe", and "Russia don't forget/ Romania is not yours to have!"
  14. Now Europe needs to take Romania seriously and stop playing pingpong with them. 

We all need to get closer.
  15. What a strange time to be alive. US elects a  fascist orange for a president while my country elects an independent candidate who won twice in the International Maths Olympics and is fluent in French.
  16. We won!! üá™üá∫üáπüá©
  17. So the Nazi guy lost? Great news.
  18. We are so back
  19. This is fucking glorious!
  20. Well done Romania!
  21. Excellent work Romania üá∑üá¥‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
  22. The relief we feel right now is real.
It has been exhausting just to think what we could have become under a Russian-controlled , extremist puppet.
  23. Ok, I just logged on and I am confused. Despite the might of the russian propaganda machine and resources (and probably more), the influence and sponsoring from far right groups and social media networks chokehold...... they elected an actual normal person that does not want to harm them?
  24. Congratulations from Hungary‚ù§Ô∏è
  25. Congratulations Romania. Hope we do the same in next 2 weeks in Poland. Nawrocki can‚Äôt win‚Ä¶
  26. So can EU finally ban TIKTOK? I swear, I probably lost hair during this last year of elections, so much propaganda from Russia, like FKING STOP. I can't take this sh\*t a 2nd time 4 and 5 years from now on, like IM FKING DONE, I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE, Just PLEASE BAN TIKTOK, EU will not exist anymore if you people don't ban TikTok, JUST DO IT ALREADY.
  27. Nice but the war against Russian stooges is far from being over. We need to dwarf these traitors at the polls. Every victory for us is one step further away from Russia attacking us militarily.
  28. As a polish, I hope the same will happen to Poland
  29. Habemus Pre»ôedinte!
  30. As a Romanian, I think I will have my best sleep in the last 6 months. We freakin' did it! I just can't believe this.
  31. Finally some good news from an election
  32. Congratulations Romania
  33. Canada! 

Australia! 

Romania! 

We are 3 for 3.
  34. Great win for Romania! Congrats from the Netherlands!
  35. It's **Dan** while the ruzzian puppet is done :)
  36. I can't believe how happy I am about this
  37. So happy for Romania and EU! This man is a gem, won IMO twice. Remember him giving multiple talks on international competitions organized in Bucharest. Wish you good luck from Serbia!
  38. Any candidate that was pro trump has lost. Happened in Canada, Australia and now Romania! Congratulations on electing a real leader!
  39. This is a great win for now, but in Europe we need to start taking Russian propaganda and interference seriously. Otherwise 5 years from now we'll be having the same discussions all over again.
  40. Must be costing Putin a fortune only to lose these elections.
  41. This is our favorite photo of him

  42. Thanks for the great news Romanian democrats. Up yours fascists
  43. We have no idea how it's gonna  be with this guy, but the general sentiment was that the alternative was far worse.

Btw the diaspora voted his opponent (an absolute mongrel) far more. An actual disgrace on our country that they voted against this guy and for the opponent who wanted to break away from the EU.

My god I'm so happy.

  66. Sending you guys praise from America! Good job
  67. As a Hungarian I would like to congratulate our eastern brothers for having elected a pro-EU president (unlike us üòû, that will hopefully change in 2026 tho). May the future be bright for y'all!
  68. So fucking proud to be Romanian! üá∑üá¥

  71. Modern elections are like 

Normal guy vs Darth Vader, choose wise
And the result are Like hooray! Only 45% choose Darth Vader!!
  72. Finally some good news! I was dreading the results of this one. Thank you Romania and congrats!!
  73. Holy shit. Huge!! Nice job üá∑üá¥
  74. Congrats Romania! Poland will follow your steps. Time to end right winged populists in central Europe who support regime of Putin in Russia.
  75. As a Romanian, these past two weeks have been ridiculously stressful. Now it feels like a monumental weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I think most Romanians feel the same. Here's to five more years in the European Community!
  76. Glory to the EUüá™üá∫
  77. Why is it that recently all elections look like this:

[  ] Decent but probably not excellent leader for your country  
[  ] Asshole who will tear down democracy and push your country on a path of destruction

And the first one *usually loses*?
  78. Think the entire world is increasingly looking towards America, Nationalism and rightwing Trumpism and thinking: **Fuck that**
  79. It's Simiover... Habemus praesidem!
  80. After a rough football night it's nice to read some good news before bed.
  81. Our president!!!
  82. Based.
  83. Are there any Bucharest residents here who could better describe Dan's achievements during his time as mayor? He's obviously smart as hell and Eurocentric, but it's interesting to see how he changed the city and the decisions he made.
  84. Nice one, Romania!
  85. Mul»õumesc frumos! I am so relieved.¬†
  86. Wow, well done, Romania!
  87. Wonderful news! Well done Romania!

  111. Congratulations for the sane decision, Romania! Let me allow to say thank you for our fellow Hungarians and Sz√©kelys as well. Greetings from Hungary! üá≠üá∫ü§ùüá∑üá¥
  112. So many close saves. So stressful!
  113. Oh thank GOD ...the last few months have been stressful as hell....
  114. It's been one hell of a week. Actually, scrape that, it's been one hell of a 6 months more like. I feel like I've been holding my breath all this time and now I can finally breathe again. Hopefully our politicians stop fighting each other and pay closer attention to the Russian threat from now on.
  115. Very good but 45% voting for an unqualified Russian plant propped solely by online disinfo is very, very troubling. We need to treat this like a plague.
  116. Slava Romania
  117. Congratulations Romania! Putin is having a bad day today. üëèüëèüëè
  118. Well done neighbours! As a Serb I am very proud of you and hopeful my country will finally get rid of filthy Russian influence soon and join you!
  119. This was a big win for the solidarity of the EU
  120. Come on Romania! Love from Switzerland‚ù§Ô∏è

Congrats fellow Europeans, you avoided the worst!
  124. As a Romanian, I am proud of the man we now call president, I am proud to be a part of the EU, and I am proud to have voted against tirany, fascism and insanity.
  125. God bless you guys!

We seriously didn't need another Trumputin ass kisser in power *anywhere*. 

Go Romania!
  126. Congrats to Romania, but 45% for the other guy, is not something to celebrate. And it's not just Romania. Those numbers, the support for the far-right, need to go down in the whole of Europe. And it's *not just* about immigrants. Loads of their voters are simply brainwashed, mainly by Kremlin propaganda and far-right propaganda channels like X and Facebook. That's something we really need to do something about. Fast. Really fast.

Because if nothing changes, next time the far-right candidate might win.
  127. üò≠üò≠üò≠ü´°ü§ß

  129. Phew! Thank God the orcs didn‚Äôt manipulate another puppet like Orban.
Romania is free.
  130. Phew.
  131. Well done, such a relief!
  132. Democracy won! Congratulations, Romania!
  133. Is that shmuck on the right a pro-ruzzian by chance?
  134. Nice.
  135. Massive fucking W
  136. Amazing news! Much love from Canada!
  137. Thank you Romania! That made me emotional! Awesome
  138. The Russia's puppet has lost. Good.
  139. Congrats from the U.S.! I feel seriously envious of every country that managed to elect intelligent leaders in recent days.
  140. Yessssss. A huge victory for both Romania and the EU.
  141. Thank god some common sense...
  142. so jealous right now
  143. Congratulations from Australia üá¶üá∫
  144. Congratulations to the Romanians. You're really great.

Maybe the pitiful and dangerous reality show of Trump's exercise of power is starting to bring voters back to their senses in Europe.
  145. Thank you, Romania, for putting some really good news in the day. 
It‚Äôs nice to see a majority of people vote like responsible adults. Hope the rest of the world takes note.
  146. We did it, your turn now:

- Poland
- Hungary
- Georgia
- Serbia
- Slovakia
  147. You guys should have seen the video. The cheers from the crowd when he hung the EU flag alongside the Romanian flag would put a smile of the face of many people in this sub.
  148. Forza Nicusor Dan! Forza Romania!
  149. Thank you, Romania!
  150. So wait - Romania didn‚Äôt vote for the Russia sponsored nazi the. ?
  151. LES GOO
  152. The best thing that has happened to the liberal parties of the world as of late is Trump. Before they squander it, of course.
  153. Congratulations Romania! People voting for smart people to lead them is much more unusual than it should be.
  154. Such a relief!
  155. Well done Romania!
  156. Good job, Romania !! Every country that votes for democracy brings us closer and closer to ending these authoritarian regimes that have started to take over this world again.   

Canada, thanks you for protecting our rights and freedoms.
  157. It‚Äôs quite a miracle! It feels like a pivotal moment for Europe and our friends.
  158. So the visit by Don Jr did not help. 
Such a pity. 
The whole MAGA universe ( or at least the ones who knew where Romania is on the map) was going for the country bumpkin.
  159. Thank fuck!
  160. Not a good day for Vladimir Putin in Romania.

  178. As one of Romanian decent I am very happy for you all.
  179. This is excellent news.
  180. Sadly in Portugal both the corrupt party and the far right have gained massive votes.   Might not be an issue right now but will be in 4 years.
  181. BRAVO !!
  182. Congratulations Romania! Best of luck.
  183. Smart move really. If the war in Ukraine comes to a manageable level for them, Russias next move will be in Moldova.

  192. I'm very glad he won but damn still 45% for a guy who didn't show up multiple times, that's scary
  193. Omfg thank fuck Simion didn‚Äôt get elected, well done Romania!
  194. Russia pumped so much money and effort into it and their guy still lost... Congrats, Romania, and many thanks!
  195. Thank you romanians... well done!
  196. I‚Äòm not gonna lie: I was really afraid that romania could turn away from our common european values. Thank you for choosing a sensible president üá™üá∫
  197. The wave continues, fantastic work Romania
  198. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs won, but I‚Äôll take integrity over super intelligence anytime. Simion has 0 kelvin integrity.

  2. More balls than most of the Arab leaders
  3. I'm sure the comments will be totally normal lmao
  4. In 2024 Spain imports nearly $1bn of products from Israel. In the same year Spain exported $1.79bn of products to Israel. In January 2025 Israel exported goods worth $55.9m and imported $121m worth. Seems a lot of ‚Äúnot doing business‚Äù. I agree with the sentiment but it‚Äôs just lip service at this point.
  5. Based
  6. Spain does business with Israel.

He is trying to score political points. I guess it‚Äôs working.
  7. It is symbolic but important to name things appropriately.
  8. So they don't buy Russian gas?
  10. I think that enough is enough. I had sympathies for Israel in the past but Israel's refusal to go with the Egyptian plan and instead openly call for The Final Solution means that it is time for the western world to recognize that Israel has transitioned into a nazi state. It is time to give Israel the North Korea treatment and sanction everything until Israel undergoes denazification.
  11. As much of an effort as Israel pumps into online disinformation it's crazy to look back a couple of years ago and see the change in language used by politicians and media around the world. Israel is being referred to in a similar way to apartheid South Africa now. Only crackpots defend Israel's actions in Gaza.
  13. Probably just the beginning of a new wave of political messaging from Europe that‚Äôs openly negative of Israel. As opposed to the more cautious previous messages. 

Israel has overstepped and Europe will turn against it now. Only hardline christians and edgy-wing-conservatives will hold a neutral or pro-Israel stance going forward.
  14. Her comes israel politicians and puppets to talk about catalonia in spain and support it to be individual country üëÄ

Even if spain do work with israel just saying that take lot of bravery so well done sir
  15. Good Spain. More countries should follow up with such statements.
  16. Over 40k upvotes üôå
  17. 880 comments and no one noticed that it's a state-run Turkish news agency putting a spin on what the Spanish PM said. Brainrot.
  18. Everybody should boycott israel
  19. Hope UAE learn a thing or two
  20. Time for Israel to be just another country, responsible for its deeds. Yes, Hamas are terrorists, but that is not excuse for levelling the whole of Gaza.  Russia would do that, Assad did it, Saddam Hussein's Irak would do that. But Israel has to do better if they expect to receive western support.
  21. God bless Spain
  22. Yay Spain! See rest of the world? It's not that hard.
  23. Fuck yeah Spain!!!
  24. Good. No one should do business with them
  25. Only speaking facts
  26. As far as I‚Äôm aware Israel‚Äôs government still has an opposition that is actually an opposition and not a bunch of puppet parties.

Not to be whataboutistic about it, but right now Russia would be the genocidal state. And I doubt talking like this is going to help out the opposition in Israel if not just straight undermines it.
  27. I wonder if Spain does any business with China or Russia? I guess they're too worried about a drop of water to notice the hail storms.
  28. Now do Russia
  29. About fkin time
  30. Good for Spain
  31. Stop doing business with Russia and mainland China then!
  32. Sad to see the AL Jazeera propaganda machine being so effective in Europe. People conveniently forget the Palestinian terror attacks of the 70s, 80s, 90s and 00s, not to mention the one in 2023. The multitude of attacks in many European countries apparently didn't teach most a lasting lesson. When the terrorists are hiding among the civilians and look like civilians what do you do? Go home and wait for another attack? I'm not saying everything Israel has done is right, but war isn't pretty and when you're fighting an unconventional enemy mistakes happen. You also have to consider that practically every country in the Middle East has publicly and repeatedly stated they want to completely destroy Israel for decades. It's easy to play like you're some bastion of humanity if you're not being constantly attacked.
  33. Really would have been relatively easy for Israel to use the ongoing hostage situation to continue blowing up stuff in Gaza while maintaining moral ambiguity - saying that they are trying to let in food aid to the population as much as possible and oh "sorry about blowing up another hospital, but there was a terrorist facility underneath," etc.

Instead Trump got elected and Netanyahu got cocky. Now he's on TV just casually like "Hey, we're gonna do a little genocide by the way. All these people here - they're going to disappear and then we're going to replace them with other people."
  34. Love to see it. 

Stand up for what‚Äôs right
  35. What are we gonna call genocide now that war = genocide?
  36. Nothing false was spoken here.
  37. Nice try, Pedro.

Spanish business definetely does business with Israel.
  38. From Islamic relief USA

Two years of crisis in Sudan has created the world‚Äôs worst hunger crisis, with famine spreading quickly across the country. Nearly 25 million people ‚Äì more than half the population ‚Äì are facing acute food shortages. Extreme violence against civilians and humanitarian aid workers, with hundreds of people killed in the last few weeks alone, has resulted in the suspension of vital humanitarian work and humanitarian catastrophe.

Funny how we only talk about a genocide that involves a certain group of people.
  39. let it be said he said this when a newspaper is having daily revelations of corruption among his close family (wife and brother) and his (to say the least) questionable involvement in using public money to rescue a company that belongs to a personal friend. He is clearly doing this to divert attention from his domestic problems and it will probably come back to bite his ass eventually...
  41. What is happening in Gaza is basically... an ethnical cleansing... a holocaust... But Jews seem to don't give a single fuck on who they are in the worlds history. They laugh, because they are strong now. But somehow are blind to realize they are now the monsters they were running from not even a hundred years ago.

I think we, especially younger Europeans should agree that the time when Israel people were considered snowflakes has ended. It ended the moment they told everyone to run to Rafah and then bombed Rafah. It ended the moment they destroyed international help car, dragged the bodies of workers who were European people and profaned them. It ended the moment they induced famine on Palestinian people.

1939 holocaust was sad - But anyway - Let's talk about the holocaust of Palestine. And until this matter is not fully solved with the full respect towards Palestinians, I don't want to hear about 1939 anymore. And I'm saying this as a Pole. I'm basically that disgusted.
  42. This is just bullshit reporting.

The PM minister was responding to a claim that referred to Israel as a genocide state. What they said was that Spain does not do business with terrorist states.

If you either failed school or were dropped on your head, let me spell it out for you: he's diplomatically implying that no one that they do business with is a terrorist state as a response.

Another thing entirely is that a group of people who seem to take offense that Spain wouldn't do business with a state just because it is into genocide, hardcore neozionist, has united hands with the group of people that want to topple Sanchez because he isn't letting their populist Trumpist opposition rule. They are cooperating because neozionists are apparently still oblivious to how Trump and Trumpist like parties are shafting Israel because they are more directly influenced by money from petrostates than the now dismantled USAID.

So if you believe that Israel IS a genocidal state, don't get your heads up about PSOE, it's still a middleman diplomatic party about this, and if you don't, you might want to read the news because it is absolutely acting genocidal and the people getting upset about this are so obviously trying to get people to accept genocidal logic that it's not funny.
  43. 1. Hamas started the war.
2. By Hamas' own count, 40,000 Palestinians died in the first year of the war

3. By Hamas' own count, less than 10,000 Palestinians died in the second year of the war 

4. Aid has been consistently flowing into Gaza from Egypt AND Israel with a few pauses that were almost immediately lifted every time.

5. The leader of Hamas that was killed was once a prisoner in Israel. He had a life threatening condition that required brain surgery, Israel provided it for free and saved his life.

6. Israel has Muslim Arab parliament members, a Muslim Arab supreme court justice, and Muslim Arabs working as professors at its universities.

7. Israel has peaceful relations with Jordan and Egypt, Muslim Arab majority nations. It's actually super easy to get along with Israel, just don't attack.

8. The 'new' leader of Hamas may have died yesterday in Gaza. He was operating immediately under a working hospital, one of countless examples of Hamas purposely endangering citizens so that they die for negative online clout.

9. After a year into the war, Israel took over a major Hamas base that was right under UNWRA headquarters. Since then, they have been able to keep the civilian population largely out of harms way, though imperfectly, which is why the death toll was largely reduced in the second year of fighting.

Taken together. The conclusion is that this is a messy and ugly war. But it is not a genocide.

Please, this is /Europe. Not a slop shop. Use your head, don't just repeat pundits.
  44. If you really believe it then take gazans as refugees then. Why would you watch ‚Äúcompletely peaceful‚Äù people being genocided? Why dont arabic countries take them as well?
  45. Same Spanish Premier that was licking Xi Jinping's boot a few months ago, yeah, ok

  48. In Spain the "prime minister" is called the president of the Government....
  49. 86 apartheid israel
  50. Is he gonna do business now with the terrorist Islamic groups?
  51. The world is starting to wake up, to see that UA-RU confilict is not half as bad as Israel and Gaza...
  52. Of course he couldn‚Äôt define genocide
  53. Calling Israel a ‚Äúgenocidal state‚Äù is not criticism. It is a blood libel. It is a deliberate, malicious distortion of reality meant to delegitimise the only Jewish state on Earth. Do you want to talk about genocide? Look at the Yazidis, the Rohingya, Rwanda, and the Uyghurs. Do not insult the memory of real genocides by weaponising the term to slander a democracy defending itself from Islamist death cults that openly call for genocide.

Repeating what certain NGOs or UN ‚Äúexperts‚Äù say does not automatically make something credible. These same bodies have a long, well-documented history of obsessive and disproportionate focus on Israel while remaining silent on atrocities in Syria, Yemen, Iran, or China. That is not moral clarity. That is political bias.

Now, let us look at the facts. Genocide has a clear legal definition: intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. If Israel were committing genocide, Gaza would no longer exist. Instead, Israel warns civilians before strikes, allows aid through, and targets a terror regime that uses its population as shields by embedding weapons in schools, hospitals, and mosques.

Calling Jews baby killers and accusing the Jewish state of genocide while excusing or ignoring the massacre of 1,200 civilians on October 7 fits the historical pattern of antisemitic defamation. It is not legal commentary. It is vilification.

Spain, by the way, has no moral high ground to lecture anyone. This is the same country that expelled its Jews in 1492, aided Franco‚Äôs bombing of civilians in Guernica, and stayed neutral while the Holocaust unfolded. Spare us the sanctimony. When a country with virtually no Jews left suddenly finds its moral voice only when it is time to condemn the Jewish state, that is not justice. That is projection.

Let us not pretend this is about human rights. You are not standing up for the oppressed. You are just comfortable with antisemitism so long as it is dressed up as ‚Äúanti-Zionism.‚Äù Denying Jews a homeland, blaming them for defending themselves, and cheering when others call them Nazis is textbook antisemitism.

Criticism is not the issue. Israel, like any healthy democracy, is constantly scrutinised by its citizens, its courts, and its media. But when criticism becomes a campaign of demonisation, when you apply double standards, erase context, and excuse terror while condemning self-defence, you are not advocating. You are dehumanising.

Israel is not perfect. No country is. But it is the only one in the Middle East where Arabs vote, LGBTQ rights are protected, and journalists are not silenced. If your moral compass leads you to demonise that state while giving actual tyrannies a free pass, it is not justice you are after. It is vengeance.

So, no, my moral compass is not broken. It is just not calibrated to hate a nation for surviving.
  54. I mean... If you are a state. And you commit genocide. What does that make you?
  55. I mean considering Spain's track record with regard to the Inquisition and whatnot... Maybe don't throw stones in glass houses?
  56. well done Spain
  57. Spanish politicians are same as Irish. They are just pleasing the left voters but still doing business with Israel behind closed doors.
  58. Spain and Ireland (and now the Netherlands) have been calling on the European Commission to review the Israel Trade Agreement under the human rights obligation within. This is perfectly in keeping with Spain's attempt to resolve something that is an EU competency.
  59. This is the same guy who voted against a condemnation of Nazi and communist crimes. His government also introduced the Democratic Memory law that hid the crimes committed by the Left during and leading up to the Spanish Civil War. This is just leftist virtue signaling from Sanchez to get back pats from his socialist colleagues.
  60. Wish France did the same
  61. Way to go Spain
  62. What are the odds this guy is taking money from an anti-isreali oil state? I'd take better then 50% odds.
  63. He‚Äôs not wrong.

It‚Äôs appalling this is happening in 2025, and Israel is bold face denying they‚Äôre committing genocide
  64. Shhh, maybe Germany might stop doing business with you. They are committed to the genocide both politically and militarily.
  65. I know a bit about how the Spanish treated the Jews in the Early Modern Era, such as the Inquistion
  66. Thank you! 

We need more European leaders like this, who dares to call out the genocidal assholes for what they are.
  67. Spain apparently forgot about it‚Äôs own special history with Islamic ‚Äúresistance‚Äù ü§£
  68. Big W for Spain. Huge respect for them
  69. Example for other EU states
  70. Ahhh - to call a spade.... a spade. Finally somebody with a sense of justice and a pair of cojones. He has mandate to do this you know, by the International Court of Justice and out common decency and respect for humanity. 

Hope he has side hustle and access to a counter-intelligence-plastic surgeon, because Mossad and the Israeli lobby are coming for himüò¨
  71. We have been saying this since the start but all we‚Äôve got is told we‚Äôre antisemitic ü§†
  72. Really wish we'd do the same here in Canada. I'll never understand why so many countries are so afraid to call Israel out for this stuff.
  73. Maybe he means Spain does not do business with Israel starting now
  74. Congratulations to Spain for recognizing what is happening in Gaza. As an American, I am ashamed we support this wanton slaughter.
  75. Ah yes, Spain, long known for its tolerance and love for Jews and other religious minorities.
  76. Irish and Spanish deserve medal of honour for not fallowing other European sheepish countries on this matter.
  77. But they do, in fact, do business with Israel. Like many other countries who say they are against the genocide. I'd wager if these countries actually stopped trading with Israel the war wouldn't last all too long.
  78. Genocide talk again, even though the Palistinian Health Ministry and the UN have backtracked on the numbers several times in the past.

People's theatrical depictions and double standard BS.

[https://gaza-civilians.airwars.org/](https://gaza-civilians.airwars.org/)
  79. There needs to be more politicians within the West to say this. 

There is a dangerous comparison now being drawn across the rest of the world that ties European support for Israel as a continuation of colonialism and that the only reason Europe stands up for Ukraine and not Palestine is the colour of their skin.

What will we say in 10 years time when thousands have been starved to death and forced from their homes? We intervened in Yugoslavia. Why not here?
  80. Meanwhile, Spain has never formally apologized for its brutal colonization of the americas and the genocides it has committed.
  81. Ok inquisitor
  82. America turning a blind eye to Israeli atrocities has emboldened putin and his Ukrainian genocide.  Spain is dope!
  83. Congratulations to this man, the first European who has the balls to tell the truth. While the rest of Europe uses the conflict in Ukraine as a smokescreen for the Genocide committed against the Palestinian people.
  84. Israel has been committing genocide against the Palestinians for 77 years causing their population to shrink from 700,000 in 1948 to over 14 million today.
  85. That the biggest moron, liar and miserable person in Europe calls Israel genocidal should be a compliment.
  86. So why doesn't Spain take in the Palestinians?
  87. Isn‚Äôt the entire western world sick of Israel yet ? They‚Äôre a bad dog on a very long leash and they‚Äôre going to stay that way until people start acting seriously about this. Were they put in a terrible situation - sure. Have they made that situation 4000x worse - also yes. Bulldozing and bombing people into submission is never going to work. It never has.  It never will.
  88. Spaniards should be proud of this political representation. Wish Italy would follow the same route.

Prevost once ran the Chicago-based province that includes Providence and St. Rita High School on the South Side, and was the order‚Äôs international leader for years

  146. Is that Pope Francis as seagull?
  147. They gonna be a lame duck pope. Doing some outreach, nothing too controversial. Nice, unoffensive person the progressive and conservative part of the Vatican can agree upon, because they are no threat to anyone. 

It needs to be said: At least they are a Trump critic. But let's see how Trump will make it about themselves and how the MAGA crowd will go completely nuts, jerking each other off over them being from the US and only getting it a couple of weeks or month that they aren't one of them.
  148. I just need to comment these thoughts. JD Vance visits the pope. The pope dies. Now there is an American pope.

I'm not saying anything but... I feel weird about that sequence of events.
  149. He's shorter than I expected. Looks good in white and grey tho. üòÇ
  150. In 2000, Prevost allowed Father James Ray, an Augustinian priest, to reside at St. John Stone Friary in Chicago under a monitor, refraining from public ministry, after the first rectory proposed for his residence was rejected by the archdiocesan review board because it was on the same property as a parish school. Ray had been suspended from public ministry since 1991 due to credible accusations of sexual abuse of minors. Ray was moved to a different residence in 2002 when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops adopted stricter rules for handling priests accused of abusing minors. - from his own Wiki
  151. Ah, yes. The Father, the Son and the Holy Seagull

  170. I always knew that seagull had the skills to be pope
  171. Depicted?
  172. Mine?
  173. I don‚Äôt understand why this is a big deal. What role does the pope play in your lives? I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
  174. He looks a little bird-like
  175. Does anyone else find it suspicious that JD Vance visits the pope and he dies the next day. Then within one of the shortest conclave ever, the new, more conservative pope is elected. And he's from the US of A? I'm just thinking that Novitjok is the Russians favorite microdosing agent and Vance is their favorite VP?
  176. I hope the new Pope will be able to clearly identify the aggressor and the victim when addressing the war in Ukraine.

Zelensky: "And then he sent this, and as you can see it goes on and on and on. All in caps. What is a covfefe?"

Macron: "That looks like a mail I got from Melenchon, to be honest. But at least Melenchon could form sentences."

Tusk: "*If I don't blink, Merz won't cross the Polish border. If I don't blink, Merz won't cross the Polish border*"

Merz: "*Should I tell Tusk that Alice Weidel is talking a lot about the Polish border in this? I better not...*"

Maybe I'm allergic to neoliberal, Chairman of the Board at Blackrock, private jet owning, "middle class" millionaires that want to cut social aid for the poorest among us. Got to power by mirroring AfD talking points, and doing an immediate 180¬∞ on their primary running platform!

hope the goverment dissolves quickly, at least he is not a full on facist, just an opportunist that would say anything to get elected, and is fine with working with the AfD to get laws passed.

  139. Had o3 analyse the pic (I attached the picture) with following prompt: ‚ÄúLook closely at the photo of five suited men (one in a black pullover) sitting on red sofas around a low table covered with papers and a phone. ‚ÄØDescribe in detail their posture, gaze, hand gestures and spacing. ‚ÄØFrom those non‚Äëverbal cues, infer:

1. the emotions each person is likely feeling,
2. the overall group sentiment,
3. how the power dynamics appear to flow, and
4. what sort of decision or outcome is most plausibly emerging from this meeting.‚Äù

Result:

|Observation (non‚Äëverbal cue)|Likely meaning|
|:-|:-|
|All five lean sharply forward toward the table, knees angled inward|High engagement; collective focus on the same material; urgency|
|Hands mostly clasped, fingers interlaced or touching lips/chin|Cognitive load: they‚Äôre processing complex information, weighing options|
|Heads tilted down, eyes fixed on papers/phone, minimal eye contact with each other|Concentration on data rather than rhetoric; they‚Äôre past persuasion and deep in problem‚Äësolving mode|
|Central figure‚Äôs elbows on knees, fingertips together forming a ‚Äústeeple‚Äù|Confidence and control; he is probably framing or summarising the next steps|
|Two figures at the ends cradle documents and pens but hold them still|Prepared to speak but withholding until consensus forms‚Äîsign of deliberation rather than debate|
|Feet planted flat, bodies symmetrical|Cooperative rather than adversarial stance; physical mirroring indicates alignment|
|Tight cluster on a small couch instead of spread around a large table|Preference for a quick, informal but strategic huddle‚Äîoften used in crisis or last‚Äëminute coordination|

**Group sentiment**  
Serious, task‚Äëoriented, slightly tense but cohesive. ‚ÄØNo open hostility; the shared forward lean and mirrored posture suggest solidarity in confronting an external challenge rather than internal friction.

**Power dynamics**  
The man in the center projects the most authority (hand‚Äësteeple, direct body orientation). ‚ÄØThe two men immediately flanking him mirror his posture, signalling support. ‚ÄØThose on the outer edges hold reference documents‚Äîoften the role of advisors supplying detail. ‚ÄØOverall: a tight core decision‚Äëmaker flanked by expert counsellors.

**Plausible meeting outcome**  
Given the gravity and alignment shown, they likely converged on a concrete, time‚Äëbounded action plan‚Äîe.g., a joint statement, emergency allocation of resources, or a coordinated diplomatic move. ‚ÄØThe absence of visible disagreement suggests the outcome was a firm consensus rather than an open‚Äëended discussion.

  1. Tusk is blond?
  2. Pretty sure this is mostly about appeasing Trump so the US continues to supply weapons. And everyone involved but Trump knows it won‚Äôt go anywhere as the Russian economy is only hanging by the thread of war. Arms deliveries to Ukraine will continue.
  3. Showing Friedrich Merz as a 2m giant is pretty good caricature work.¬†


I'm starting to doubt about how big the russian capacities are that they ignore the ceasefire. Stay strong brothers,
–°–ª–∞–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ üá∫üá¶üí™
  4. Russia just loves wars
  5. Why does Macron look like an antisemitic caricature?
  6. Can we...erm...talk about Zelenskyy's buns? üçë
  7. So many deleted comments wtf.
  8. Few months ago everyone agreed that a ceasefire will only benefit Putin
  9. That‚Äôs so correct!
  10. I feel like this shows an extreme lack of understanding of the point of what these leaders are doing with this ceasefire demand

Unless I'm reading it wrong and it's not making fun of them
  11. A basic reality of humans is that if you accept or tolerate the behavior of a bully or tyrant it will continue. It requires force by the those subject to abuse to stop it. 
Negotiations will not stop the abuse. 
History and personal experiences show this truth repeatedly.
  12. Why zelensky got the cake ü•¥ü§ö
  13. well are they just gonna stand there?
  14. wrong, the russians actually say "333"
  15. Better do a drug test on the coalition of the willing.
  16. I do not understand, why the EU wants peace.

Our main priority shall be returning the russia back to its borders from 90s.

Among other things, we still have the $200 billion in russian frozen assets, that we should have confiscated and given to Ukraine years ago to buy weapons...
  17. The problem with the ceasefire is that it doesn't end the conflict and would help one side vastly more than the other. The Russians have paid a heavy price for the territories they now hold, I doubt they would willingly give back these territories and pay compensation when they are nowhere near being defeated. 

Also, the joint statement between Russia and China with China blaming the West (particularly the US) and openly supporting Russia leads me to think that we might see the Chinese send missles and other weapons if the Russian starts to struggle after the increase in aid is given to Ukraine. My fear is that this conflict can easily scale up to potentially WW3.

  19. We just need to express our concerns one more time, maybe it'll show them.
  20. Me waiting for Russia to send compensation for the Chernobyl bombing
  21. Lol, guys issuing an ultimatum is not what negotiating peace looks like. If you want peace, you have to negotiate and both sides of a conflict have to compromise and find common ground during the negotiation process.
  22. Curiously, it was Ukraine who violated cease fire in the Victory Day, it is unbelievable how this subreddit is purely propaganda.
  23. Pretty accurate, yeah.
  24. This war could've been over in like two weeks if western politicians weren't massive fucking pussies and gave Russia the Iraq treatment when they first invaded. Obviously Russia isn't going to agree to a ceasefire when they're winning and the only thing the rest of Europe does is shake their fist at them
  25. Successful ceasefires need people on both sides regardless of the moral question. Pakistan ostensibly helped a terrorist attack in India (allegedly) but was found to have many allies in the international scene (arguably more so than India). They weren‚Äôt cut off from the world and isolated, neither was India. Lo and behold, it allowed for a ceasefire to be negotiated through international partners. 

In the cases of Russia, or groups like Hamas or the Houthis. There isn‚Äôt any will to be neutral or cross lines. So nothing will change.
  26. Winning sides do not agree to ceasefires. They're not going to give Ukraine a chance to breath and re-arm when they have them on the ropes like this.
  28. It's funny to watch you dogs lavish your support into Ukraine when it has been verified that every cease fire has been broken by Ukraine, minsk accords 1&2 etc this is all well known within the UN reports , I love seeing ignorant baboons chiming their support for Ukraine just like they do for Israel because neither can do any wrong and neither have Nazi problems right lmao
  30. The whole ceasefire idea is really bad imo when Russia is on the ropes and struggling and Ukraine can keep up the pressure with the help of other countries. This doesn't end with Russia just accepting they shouldn't have invaded Ukraine and all their troops going back home.


Russia needs to collapse and Putin needs to be removed from power. They need to no longer be a future threat to anyone on earth.¬†

  40. Yeah in all honesty this is how it feels everytime Russia has agreed to one of these or even a temp truce.
  41. But have they caught all the Nazis yet?
  42. I'm getting tired of the games they are playing...
  43. Why Zelenskyy so caked up?
  44. Yeah right, Ukraine is the one walking away
  45. Why Selensky caked up tho and why the chancellor so long tho
  46. Russia hasn't achieved its targets yet, so asking for ceasefire is useless. Either defeat Russia or capitulate.
  47. SIEK!
  48. They should all be standing behind Zelensky litterally... and Zelensky should be standing behind a large pile of gravestones
  49. Edgy
  50. Direct negotiations are a good idea.
  51. Russia wants to start real peace nagotiations in Instambul. This ceasefire would not bring any peace, it would only give both sides time to regroup and preapare more offensives. Lets hope that peace talks  will actualy work out this time
  52. Not bad, but It looks like Gaza, and then they wouldn't be there asking for a cease
  53. Artist's licking asses of EU presidents by painting them on a line of fire is just ridiculous

  66. Why is Zelenskyy so caked up
  67. ‚ÄúPeace agreement will take one day‚Äù ü¶ß
  68. The universal truth is ultimately that might makes right.  It's an uncomfortable truth but it's exactly what it is.
  69. Don't tell folks that in 2022 Zelensky avoided the Istanbul Ceasefire Agreement, mostly drafted by Ukraine, because Biden promised him Security Guarantees and how Boris Johnson convinced him he'd come out of this "a hero of the people", if he declined. Now he knows he wont get a deal like this anymore and so now it's just a matter of keeping the war going until he gets a chance to save his face.
  70. Guys. Russia is in a momentum now. They are taking land last 6 month and arent losing any position. From strategit stand point obviously they wont sign any deal now. Every dude knowing smrh about warfare knows this. Why Ukraine is pushing for peace? Cuz without help they are slowly gonna lose. Despite Russia losing more man, in long run, Ukraine cant win this. And Russia will prolly push as much as they can until they decide they have had enough. Cuz stoping war now doesnt benefit them in any way. Sanctions wont go away and Ukraine and allies could use extre time to arm Ukraine and give it logistics. Sure, Russia can do it also, but now they have momentum. Imagine Ukraine seeking cease fire in summer 2022 when thay had that big offensive
  71. Spot on ! hehehh
  72. Put a US flag next to Russias and it‚Äôs more accurate
  73. I don‚Äôt thin that Russia is interested in a cease fire, they seem to want a permanent peace deal instead.
  74. A classic for western media, portray that the west is weak and Russia is strong
  75. It's just sad how accurate this is.

  82. Oh, the absolute tragedy of Zelensky not being the one holding the Ukrainian flag. One might almost mistake him for a mere tourist, accidentally wandering into a photo op.
  83. Why didn't they say "case" against each other? When they destroyed Iraq, Syria, and other countries like that?
  84. ‚ÄúWe are running out of ammo and people, give us a break!!!‚Äù
  85. Why did he give Zelenskyy such big cheeks¬†
  86. Truth
  87. EU wants war to continue at all cost. This strip is b.s.
  88. Same here in Indo Pak Conflict. India-Cease, Pak-Fire.
  90. DAYM, why did they have to make Zelenskyy so  **T H I C C**  ?
  91. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  92. If Russia won't listen, they will soon meet the true force of the west. If they nuke, everyone is going to die, but they won't because it makes no sense. Putin is coming to an end and everyone¬† on both sides will benefit from him to either die or retire. Even China will turn their back to him if NATO gets involved, because they don't want the world to end. Hopefully the little bastard will end up in Haag.
  93. oh reminds me of israel but you cheer for the zionist so why shouldnt i cheer for putin
  94. –ó–∞–±—ã–ª–∏ —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å?
  95. Coke heads
  96. GLORY OF THE MOTHER RUSSIA
  97. Imagine believing this
  98. Peace is attained by negotiation not ultimatums stop pretending that yall are any different to Russia you want blood and they want blood exactly the same on different sides
  99. and I thought Ukraine was winning. What happened there?
  100. Funny seeing as Zelensky refused to agree to peace and instead begged America for more money and guns.
  101. nah‚Ä¶ cringe
  102. Trying to make the same trick as before. Not this time. No opportunity for Ukraine to regroup and rearm with help of european fascists.
  103. So Apt !
  104. Who gives a shit about Ukraine or Israel for that matter? Not our war and not our problem.
  105. Last time I checked it was the west encouraging Zelensky to not sign Russia‚Äôs earlier peace offerings
  107. Did Ucraine stop fire on Donesk and Lugansk when they wanted Independence? No... They did kill the independentist
  108. üòÇ
  109. Why is zelensky caked up?
  110. –° –î–Ω–µ–º –ü–æ–±–µ–¥—ã!
  111. Words versus actions
  112. Wow.... So deep.... War..... Is over
  113. Has anyone read through Baba Vangas predictions on this from when she was alive? Everything is planned out.

  1. Probably the youngest looking pope picture I think I‚Äôve ever seen.
  2. He had to do it to them
  3. He's 69 years old, doesn't look a day over 56. He's gonna be pope for like 35 years at this rate.
  4. He looks... happy? Carefree maybe? I don't think I've seen a pope that happy before. I imagine a few years will change that though.
  5. "Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?"
  6. He looks like a genuinely kind man.
  7. In the movie Conclave there‚Äôs a scene where someone says they all have a papal name lined up. I wonder when that usually happens ‚Äì right at the start of seminar, when you start going up the ranks, on the way to Rome for the conclave? Given all the stuff that people read into the name, it‚Äôd be cavalier to wait until the last moment.
  8. what you think his set bonus are
  9. He's got that happy-to-meet-you look about him. 

Please keep Vance far away from him.
  10. Wouldn't it be amusing if the next photo depicted Pope Leo as the President of the United States? Well, I think the Pope could actually make America great again.
  11. America now have legit world leader whose elected by merit and liked by many. Hope Papa Leo continues Papa Francis works.
  12. I have cautious optimism about his papacy. He seems to be following in the footsteps of Pope Francis, so that's a good sign. We'll just have to wait and see where he takes the church
  13. He looks kind.
  14. This looks cool.
  15. He reminds me of John Paul II, he is just as committed as him, he is going to be a political pope.
  16. I‚Äôm an atheist. Actually, more correctly an anti-theist. But this dude looks like the kind of neighbour who would bring cookies over for Christmas.
  17. Quite noisy, what was the ISO setting?
  18. Left the church decades ago, but I respected Francis' commitment to the much simpler, plain white robes. It makes seeing this vestment here seem so gaudy by comparison.
  19. He looks very Popey. Is that a requirement when selecting popes?
  20. [And here he is in another light...](https://imgur.com/a/tuX8iad)
  21. He looks like he's just a little guy.
  22. He's just a little cutie patootie
  23. Is he Peruvian American or just American?
  24. Wow... This is amateur photography. I know a budget af photographer from a flea market that can take better. Even the background sucks. Did anyone not give a hoot that day?
  25. Not quite as modest as Francis, but still pretty humble. He has a calm and friendly aura, so let's see where this goes.
  26. Just like jesus used to dress!
  27. He looks like he has the signature Polish smile
  28. He looks so nice
  29. Yo this guy is 69?? Homie is aging like fine wine gotta have an easy 20-30 more yrs out of him lol.
  30. Can I just say the all white outfit seems a lot more pope-y to me than this one? But I'm not Catholic so it's probably recency bias.
  31. > The Vatican release the first official portrait of **of Pope**  Leo XIV


shit he's so progressive that he have started an Onlyfans (/joke)
  32. I love him already!
  33. habemus papam!
  34. why does it look like it was taken on an iphone

the photographer really be like, "ooh this background looks lit, stand there for a sec"
  35. He Looks Gangster. I like it
  36. I was cautious at first but I'm down with this pope. He seems to have the right perspective on Catholicism
  37. He looks like Indian uncle if he does the head nod
  38. Already 4th pope during my lifetime and I'm only 31 üëÄ
  39. When are we going to have a Pope with beard?
  40. Reminds me of [Will Bailey of West Wing](https://westwing.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Bailey).
  41. Cute outfit, love the color pop. Cults always have such interesting fashion. I like the pomp of the Catholics - so much more flashy than the Little House on the Prairie vibe of the Mormon cult and way more showy than the bedsheet vibe of that other big cult, you know the one.
  42. he looks like he's about to tell me he'll be looking at my career with great interest
  43. This looks like a picture they would use for his work ID badge.
  44.  1985 swag
  45. Where‚Äôs the Apple Watch
  46. I would like to hear his official position on deep dish pizza.
  47. My 7th Pope.  I have a good feeling on that one. :)
  48. Wait, you mean Trump lost?
  49. I'm digging the cyberpunk fashion.
  50. Brotha got the drip on üî•
  51. Nice canon rebel xt shot
  52. Finally we get a pope with house music. Dancing will save us all.
  53. reminds me of that [Kevin James meme](https://imgur.com/a/bq4YzPd)
  54. Nobody rocks a vestment like Leo XIV baby!
  55. Daaaaaaaa Pope
  56. GILF
  57. Lmao he's so awkward in front of cameras
  58. aura
  59. His stats are on the back. You want the early releases before he gets traded.
  60. As long as he lives, Chicago is going to milk him for all he's worth.
  61. They really get stuff done and don‚Äôt mess around in the Vatican. New pope voted in and established within minutes, it feels like.
  62. Da Bulls.
  63. I'm just gonna say it, I don't like the lightning at all. It's way to bright.
  64. He looks pleasantly awkward. I like it.
  65. He is more of working on the ground Pope, because of his missionary background in Peru, his hands on connection to marginalized people rather than an articulated, writer pontiff like Pope Benedict xvi. Hope he should ignored all the labelling may it progressive, conservative, traditionalist, liberal, centrist, leftist, rightist, whatsoever just follow in the Commandments and Teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ, that's what matters.
  66. he looks like a chill dude
  67. He genuinely looks calm and happy. What a gift to the world.
  68. I don‚Äôt like the lighting on his face with shadows from the glasses. Looks like they didn‚Äôt hire photographer?
  69. So supposedly he is infallible now under certain circumstances, and divinely guided. Do you think he feels different? Or if he wonders why God does not seem to be guiding him?
  70. He has the same look we have in Chicago when the train takes too long and when it finally comes the door that opens in front of you has a smelly human in it making a scene.
  71. *you know I had to pope it to em*
  72. He looks like the main villain from a secret society. Definitely stores a gun in a hollowed out Bible.


Doesn't have the same friendly face Pope Francis had.
  73. You know he had to do it to ‚Äòem
  74. He looks kinda prideful.
  75. Yep, that's me. You're probably wondering how I got here.
  76. I like that he looks awkward guy who was coerced into taking a photo
  77. Bob Pope
  78. Boys, get ready
  79. For an official portrait, it's not a great photo, is it?
  80. He looks like he's got a belter of a joke and is waiting for everyone to be listening
  81. That's my Pope!
  82. He looks kind.
  83. His smile makes me smile!
  84. Pop Bob :)
  85. Everyone‚Äôs saying how young he looks.

The record to beat is 31y, 7m, 23d.
  86. Interestingly, the new pope has so far consistently used the Italian form *Leone* instead of the Latin *Leo* when signing.
  87. That's baller
  88. 
Hey /u/bendubberley_,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
  89. I am very hopeful for this Pope and I pray for him, but he feels scared. There are some major issues to deal with I think.
  90. out of the last 4 popes, none of them have been Italian.
  91. So is this just European tradition at this point or do people really believe these guys have mystical powers?
  92. Why does this look like a Renaissance album drop?
  93. I can't get over how much he just looks like a regular guy at church. Approachable and friendly, very unassuming of the role. Likely still hasn't wrapped his head around the idea yet. It's sort of fascinating in a "King Ralph" kind of way. I hope he maintains this image.
  94. Bro got the drip!
  95. He's the most sweetest looking pope ever, look at him really just a chill guy!!
  96. Ah, Palpatine!!
  97. üëç
  98. I need a new pope now
  99. is the picture actually this grainy or is this a reddit 5000 layers of jpg compression?
  100. 69, just a fuckin' kid
  101. Looks intelligent and kind, only time will tell.
  102. "Not now, Pierce!"
  103. and so he goes down in history‚Ä¶ congratulations!
  104. aaah.he‚Äôs my daddy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
  105. Wdym portrait thats a photo üò≠
  106. I want to give him a 2 handed handshake where both our hands remain horizontal with the right palm facing towards the floor and the left palm towards the ceiling. 

I‚Äôm high and feel like there was an easier way to say that, ‚ÄúI want to clasp his hands‚Äù? I dunno that ain‚Äôt right either
  107. It‚Äôs nice having a pope that doesn‚Äôt appear to be at deaths door
  108. You can almost see the Apple Watch
  109. PAPA AMERICANO
  110. P. Ope!
  111. Based!
  112. of of
  113. Oh hell pope leo of the south side
  114. Leo XIV? Does he also dance?
  115. Crazy how old the Roman Catholic Church is. He‚Äôs just a flash in the pan.
  116. I am genuinely so surprised he has a wife and kids. Speaks for my ignorance, but I really thought popes didn't have their V card stamped. Edit: Not factual. I apologise for any perceived harm I may have caused.
  117. The really funny thing is seeing him move imo. I am used to an old man moving really slow or even using a wheel chair. He just walks totally normal
  118. You know he had to do it to ‚Äòem
  119. Their all lovely Popes Father
  120. he clearly likes big glasses!
  121. Leo looks  to be in great health
  122. God save Pope Leo XIV the American
  123. Sooo how many pedophiles has he protected?
  124. He looks so cute with that smile!! Love it üòÅ
  125. Why he looks like someone who would send plx fix emails
  126. He‚Äôs giving me great hope ‚ò∫Ô∏è
  127. As a swede, we didnt win the 30 years war to care about the pope.
  128. Oh hey, it‚Äôs in 4k this time
  129. Know I had to do it to em
  130. Looks just like leuttinent Dan
  131. He is going to make such a good Pope! Huzzah!
  132. Do it to em
  133. The Pope‚Äôs brother is a Radical Right Wing Christian Terrorist.
  134. Would be fitting if this Leo lived longer than the previous Leo.
  135. he looks so chill
  136. He's like Francis but with more guts
  137. Same old stuff just anther day.
  138. Whats with the gold ring? Isn‚Äôt that vanity?
  139. Non zero chance that this guy saw the Emoji Movie in theaters
  140. You'd think the Vatican would spring for a professional portrait. Not like they're short on cash.
  141. Guys. Los Angeles checking in I really hope we don‚Äôt fuck this up.
  142. The smile tells me he has a lot going on and can't wait to share.
  143. Nah, he Drippin'!

  152. Congrats üïåüïå
  153. He is going to bring people back to the church, I can feel it in my soul. I pray for reconciliation with some of our protestant brother and sisters in christ as well.
  154. why do they no get an amazing professional photograph done like they do at the Oscars. the tight framing and high lighting on his glasses/eyes are...

and so much noise with 2 key lights
  155. Drip
  156. bro could at least look at the camera

pretty rude
  157. Eh‚Ä¶.
  158. He reminds me of someone, but I can‚Äôt figure out who
  159. Look at that drip on him though
  160. They need to hire a better photographer
  161. Let‚Äôs hope dis one doesn‚Äôt like children in the wrong way

  168. The most politically powerful American in the world
  169. Still giving of the Papa Palps vibe :(
  170. Nice drip
  171. dripped out
  172. There‚Äôs just an aura about him that makes him very likeable to me. He looked very emotional too the day he was elected. Plus he‚Äôs got a math degree, has progressive policy views in continuation with the previous pope, his papal name symbolising worker rights in the nascent stages where AI is beginning to emerge; just seems like a great leader. Only time will tell, but idk I find him very admirable.
  173. Fuck the pope and his bullshit cult
  174. For real looks like he should manage a Jersey Mikes
  175. You know he had to do it to them

  3. Fuck yeah!!

Currently laying in bed enjoying such freedom for salazar and the PIDE(State police)

Also, bloodless overthrow!
  4. [A perfect time to remember the evil authoritarianism has caused](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution)

P.S: minor spelling mistake, it's overthrew. Sorry!
  5. I was in Porto then, 16yrs old RN HMS Apollo
  6. And with almost no victims - 5 dead, at the end on the 25th, shows that this was a revolution with the support of the vast majority of the population, military included.
  7. April 25th, always.
  8. Fun fact: it's also the 80th Anniversary of the Partisan Liberation of Italy against nazifascism! We share the same date of Liberation from the fascist dictatorship, although 29 years apart. üá™üá∫‚ù§Ô∏èüáÆüáπüáµüáπ
  9. Buon 25 aprile, here in Italy as well we are remembering the end of Fascism in 1945.

Ora e sempre Resistenza!
  10. Funny that only 51 years ago there was a dictatorship in a European Union country. Thanks Portugal, you give my homeland Turkey hope!
  11. My wife's family is Portuguese and to this day my father-in-law, Jose, when he goes to the toilet states he is going to "Write a letter to Salazar" and that is just hilarious to me.
  12. I was in Lisbon for tourism during Easter, and I visited the [Aljube Museum Resistance and Freedom](https://www.museudoaljube.pt/en/). It is hosted in a former dictatorship prison. Go visit it if you can; it will be a good reminder that freedom is not a given.
  13. Here's to the next 51 year. Liberdade.
  14. And yet the autocracy still seems popular and common in Europe nowadays. You just can't rid of it entirely.
  15. I love how is called *Revolu√ß√£o dos cravos*. In Italy the symbol of resistance against fascism is still a flower but it's the poppy. Congratulations Portugal üáµüáπ‚ù§
  16. Pastel de nata for everyone!!!!
  17. I hope that we, as the Turkish people, will see these days again in our country, just like in 1960.
  18. And this song was the signal for the revolution https://youtu.be/jqd2PD8MXVc?si=-2zAPHuz8A46gNoP
  19. FASCISMO NUNCA MAIS!
  20. Gr√¢ndola, vila morena...
  21. Congrats Portugal!¬†


Seeing this thread title as well as all those moustaches in the picture has caused the following song to pop into my head:¬†


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hha0bwVvGmY


Portugal. The Man - Live in the Moment!¬†
  22. ya'll got any notes on how that was accomplished? Asking for a republic I know.
  23. So important to remember dates like this! 

Vai Portugal! üáµüáπ
  24. Based irm√£os
  25. Don't forget that the military was supporting the people which is quite different from other countries, but one can hope
  26. Hope we can do the same with Turkey
  27. Freedom and peace FTW!
  28. It always makes me laugh when Russians/Chinese always say things like ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt expect us to speak up, we live in a dictatorship‚Äù

Yeah **That‚Äôs the point** 

Practically every single democracy _fought_ for it. It‚Äôs even easier today with the way we can communicate through millions at a press of a button. 

Of course it doesn‚Äôt always work but that still doesn‚Äôt stop people, look at the brave Hong Kongers or the women of Iran and of course, the brave men and women of Ukraine who prove that Ukrainians are _nothing_ alike to Russians.
  29. I wish to see it in Turkey too.
  30. 25 de Abril Sempre!
  31. Looking at you, America... ü´†
  32. It also marks 50 years of its first free elections (constitutional assembly)
  33. It's crazy to think that there were dictatorships in western Europe in the 70's.
  34. \*overthrew its
  35. We got a holiday in commonüáÆüáπ
  36. 25 de abril sempre, fascismo nunca mais.
  37. Someone explain to me how my mother went from experiencing this to voting for Trump.
  38. Hey Portugal.    
  
You got any tips?   
  
signed, America
  39. And sadly we have extreme-right POS attacking people on the streets for celebrating this day.
  40. Good job Portugal! ‚úä Viva a Liberdade! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I visited last year and was happy to attend the 50 year anniversary, got a nice video that night 

https://youtu.be/yUO1N8z4EyA?si=SjERmrAzRou0Zyjv
  41. Con mis padres en Coimbra, felicidade irmaos portugueses,
  42. And the launch of the coup that overthrew the dictatorship was announced by the song *Gr√¢ndola, Vila Morena*, by Zeca Afonso (beautiful song)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A2ndola,\_Vila\_Morena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A2ndola,_Vila_Morena)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaLWqy4e7ls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaLWqy4e7ls)
  43. Just wanted to share one of the quotes by Salgueiro Maia, one of the military leaders of this revolution. This is how he convinced his troops to march to Lisbon and join the revolution:

> Gentlemen, as you all know, there are three kinds of states: capitalist states, socialist states, and the state we've come to. Now, in this solemn night, we are going to end this state! So that anyone who wants to come with me, we go to Lisbon and finish it. This is voluntary. Who does not want to leave, stay here!

All of them joined.
  44. As a Frenchman, I never accepted to go to Portugal or Spain as long as they were dictatorships. But when I could go there, I discovered they were lovely people.

The dictatorship has lasted from 1933 to 1974 in Portugal. Let's hope that a great country that has recently fallen into dictatorship in January 2025 is not gone to stay that long.
  45. The kind old lady who began the "Carnation" part of the revolution passed away last November, aged 91.

Celeste Caeiro‚Äôs small gesture named a revolution 
https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/11/28/celeste-caeiros-small-gesture-named-a-revolution

Tiny as she was, she showed up in the crowd with her brisk, determined walk and her big sheaf of bright red flowers. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers stood in the square; soldiers on the tanks told her they had been there, waiting for Caetano to surrender, since three in the morning. Not surprisingly one of them, calling her ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam‚Äù most politely, asked her for a cigarette.  He looked exhausted. She felt sorry for him, but she didn‚Äôt smoke and never had, because she was so chesty. Perhaps she could buy him a sandwich? No, everywhere was closed. So, reaching up on tiptoe, she gave him a carnation.

He did not have to accept it. He could have laughed at her, or tossed it away. Many men would have done: her own father, or Helena‚Äôs father, the ones who walked  out on women. But he took it gladly, and put it in the barrel of his rifle. That meant he could not shoot now; and suddenly, his comrades also wanted one. They would be an army of peace. Her flowers ran out, but soon other people brought carnations too, including all the florists who worried, like Mr Chaves, that their stock would die otherwise.

Back in the flat in Chiado later, she stood at the window watching. People filled the streets, and many had carnations. It made her smile. By the evening, Caetano had surrendered. Her mother cried ‚ÄúYou could have been shot!‚Äù, but she had never thought that. The whole thing seemed almost accidental. She had offered a soldier a flower. He had stuck it into his gun. This had turned into a statement that grew stronger and stronger. Peace against war (only four people died in this revolution); good against evil; freedom against oppression; new versus old. It was a statement that resonated far beyond Portugal, especially in Africa, where one by one the former colonies gained their independence.
  46. A far right, anti-socialist, anti-liberalism dictatorship. When will humans learn the far right is always wrong?
  47. i am going to Portugal in 3 weeks 

cannot wait
  48. Can‚Äôt wait for Russia to have theirs.
  49. Last year 219000 in Lisbon alone marched to celebrate and fight for freedom (up from less than 100000 in 2023). This year, we look to be in the hundreds of thousands as well, fighting for our rights and life. Join us!
  50. I envy all the countries that liberated themselves of an oppressive regime, may it be foreign or domestic. Unfortunately, not everybody was able to do it themselves without foreign involvement.
  51. Hey USA‚Ä¶ take notes.
  52. I very rarely care about feeling "proud" of my country achievements

but if I were portuguese, I would feel proud af about that
  53. Lets see if the US can follow their great example!
  54. If they can do it, we can do it. If anyone can do it, we can do it
  55. You're telling me I missed the 50 year anniversary by a month when I visited Porto last year? Bit of a shame, but I do recall a lot of red carnations and murals
  56. Congratulations, Portugal!
  57. half of my family escaped the Azores in the 50's to get away from Salazar and his dictatorship.
  58. Encouraging!

  60. Detail: it was a very peaceful revolution
  61. Simpathy from Italy, we also got rid of our dictatorship and fascist, but they seem to have made a comeback‚Ä¶
  62. That's 1974, quite modern times
  63. Wow, so Portugal also had a dictatorship.  
I knew about Spain with Franco, but i didn't realise that Portugal had issues as well.  
Sheesh, so happy they got out of that. They deserve better.

  73. Hmm someone needs to make a list of the day every dictatorship fell, and make a big deal out of each. As a reminder.

You know, for a friend.
  74. Was this the one where the signal to start the revolt was when Portugal‚Äôs Eurovision entry that year started singing?
  75. Viva Portugal!
  76. Which directly resulted in independence for Angola, and began the end of the South Africa border war which resulted in the birth of independent Namibia.
  77. Sorry for stumbling in here from the front page but does anyone have any recommendations for books, documentaries, podcasts, etc. about the Carnation Revolution? It's a fascinating moment in modern history that just doesn't get much coverage in the US. Not even in the context of the Cold War.

My grandfather was stationed in Spain and Portugal in the post-war period, but long before the fall of the Francoist and Estado Novo regimes.
  78. >it‚Äôs dictatorship

*its
  79. **The "Revolu√ß√£o dos Cravos" (Carnation Revolution)** was a peaceful military coup in Portugal on April 25, 1974, led by lower-ranking officers of the Armed Forces Movement (MFA). It ended nearly 50 years of authoritarian rule under the Estado Novo regime. The revolution not only restored democracy but also triggered the decolonization of Portuguese territories in Africa and paved the way for Europe‚Äôs first socialist constitution in 1976. Its peaceful nature and sweeping impact make it one of the most significant democratic transitions of the 20th century.

The **Carnation Revolution** was triggered by a song broadcast on the radio as a secret signal to launch the coup. On the night of **April 24, 1974**, at **10:55 p.m.**, the banned song **‚ÄúE Depois do Adeus‚Äù** by Paulo de Carvalho was played on **Emissores Associados de Lisboa**. This served as the first signal to alert the conspirators that the operation was about to begin.

Then, at **12:20 a.m. on April 25**, a second song‚Äî**‚ÄúGr√¢ndola, Vila Morena‚Äù** by Zeca Afonso‚Äîwas played on **R√°dio Renascen√ßa**. This was the definitive signal for the MFA to move forward with the coup. The song, which celebrated fraternity and equality, had been censored under the regime, so its airing was itself a powerful symbol of defiance.

These musical signals coordinated military actions across the country without alerting the regime‚Äîmaking it a revolution not just led by soldiers, but also sparked by songs.

But then Spain and Portugal remained Fascist And I feel I should know more about this period of history 

I don't even know where a good source of material would be to start looking into life under Salazar or even Franco's Spain

A Day to remember and be proud of none the less

  151. I thought that was the death mobile from animal house for a second
  152. I gotta be honest, I had no idea they were ever in a dictatorship. I need to watch more documentaries
  153. I can't believe they still had a dictator 50 years ago... That's not that long ago.
  154. Anything is possible.

  162. Is that a British Ferret Armoured car they are riding in?
  163. The fact that portugal overthrew a dictator without killing (almost) anyone is actually pretty cool. It shows how the revolution wasnt so deadly. One of the very few revolutions in history that ended peacefully, without the death of thousands of innocents

  168. Here the last 4 years the US has been trying to create one
  169. Friends in Portugal are still dealing with ramifications and fallout from this regime. But they are heartily glad they are gone.

  176. 25 Abril sempre! Fascismo nunca mais!
  177. What a coincidence. Today, an American judge was arrested for not following the president's illegal goon squad's orders....
  178. When is America doing this?
  179. Wonder if Americans can grow a pair and do the same. So far trump is laughing at them. He‚Äôs depending on your complacency think about it.
  180. You‚Äôre not wrong
  181. And later joined the peace project called EU,
  182. ‚ÄúWhen the dictatorship is a reality, the revolution is a right‚Äù
  183. Very cool
  184. I wonder what year America will overthrow their MAGA Fascist masters?
  185. Nice
  186. Grats to Portugal!

Also, what are they driving?
I want one.
  187. Hoping this happens in my country soon
  188. 25 de Abril!!
  189. üéâ
  190. Also interesting is that although it was a military revolution, only 4 people died, killed by PIDE agents.
  191. Congratulations Portugal!
  192. Proud of Portugal!
  193. And the United States did it with an election. What a GREAT country
  194. 51 years ago was 1974 when Poland was a Soviet puppet state, and it remained so until the early 90's. Am I missing something here?
  195. Americans are gonna be needing this energy soon.
  196. Way to go, Portugal.
  197. Hey Russians. Look. It can be done.
  198. Now we just need this in America¬†
  199. Ah 25 of April the day our "dictator" fell and the war ended by completely stepping over both Portuguese and colonial troops who did not want independence at all. Also the day where all the sly foxes got their grubby little paws on the main government and have been ruling and sinking our country deeper and deeper in depth for more than 50 years truly an amazing feat.
  200. I know Salazar was a dictator, was he also fascist like some people claim?

**Title:** Finland to criminalise Holocaust denial
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 42261
**Comments (101):**
  1. >The government is proposing to add a provision to the criminal code to outlaw Holocaust denial and other serious international crimes.

>Suggesting that the Holocaust did not happen will become a punishable offence, with the penalty ranging from a fine to two years' imprisonment.

>The government submitted the legislative proposal to Parliament on Thursday, with the law expected to come into force this autumn.

>The Finnish government proposal is based on the EU's framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia.
  2. Meanwhile, Oklahoma has added to its curriculum that Trump won the 2020 election.
  3. Meanwhile in Italy: people people reported for singing "Bella Ciao" near Bergamo and a baker identified by the police because she hung an anti-fascist banner outside her bakery.
  4. Step in right direction.
  5. For context: the current government was embroiled in several scandals over the Finns' Party's far right connections during the summer of 2023. Their [minister of economy had to resign](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66066910) and the leader of the party [was caught writing hateful content online](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66166795). The Prime Minister (of a different party, to clarify), held a "rules talk" with the Finns' Party ministers and [decided, as a gesture of 'zero tolerance for racism', to move towards criminalizing Holocaust denial and displaying the swastika](https://yle.fi/a/74-20047962). This was in August 2023. 

After half a year of nothing coming of it, it was reported that the [Justice Minister had intentionally stalled the advancement of the law](https://www.savonsanomat.fi/uutissuomalainen/6717698) (she's also a member of the Finns Party). 

Now, it's worth noting that holocaust denial is already covered by the definition of the crime of "inciting against a group of people", carrying a maximum penalty of two years in prison. This has been the case for ages. It just hasn't been explicit, and the EU commission has previously criticized this.

In the autumn of 2024, our government, preparing this new law specifically criminalizing the holocaust, [proposed *lowering* the maximum sentence from what it was under the other criminal code](https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/hs-hallitus-aikoo-lieventaa-rangaistuksia-holokaustin-kiistamisesta/9003814). 

Now it finally seems to be coming to fruition. But it's worth keeping in mind that the right-wing Finns Party in the government dragged their feet every single step of the way to this point.
  6. Queue the ‚Äúcritical thinkers‚Äù who will enter the chat and comment that this isn‚Äôt democratic when the exact thing tearing down western democracies right now among many other things are holocaust deniers.

Yes, you can get charged when your plan is to democratically tear down the democracy. That is how democracy works. A voice that advocates for the removal of democracy and free speech is in fact not allowed.
  7. Are there any other events in history that are illegal to question?
  8. Acts of genocide shouldn't be forgotten. What the Tudors did to the Irish isn't taught outside Ireland, but the English massacred and enslaved millions of Irish. They were probably the first white slaves in the English colonies in the Americas.
  9. It's just dumb. Anyone denying the holocaust is an idiot. Just like anyone denying other proven genocides are idiots. There's nothing special about this genocide compared to others. There's no reason for a special treatment for this specific case. 

What nazis did should  never be forgotten, but others have done the same. No special treatment to other criminals.
  10. Love that for Finland.
  11. The Neo-Nazi posters seem very upset about this one.
  12. I read this as "decriminalize" because I'm so used to bad news¬†
  13. Can someone genuinely enlighten me on how this serves any purpose at all? Who is being harmed by someone who doesn't believe in a historical event. How is it serious enough to be a crime? Surely education is the solution.
  14. This is always a smart ban to implement because it hits all the right people. The classic European far-right (Fascists), the new far-right (Islamists, to lesser extent christian fundamentalists) and far-left extremists.

Antisemitism is the one thing they all agree on, and there is no crime they are more happy to deny than the holocaust

Edit: If new accounts, which exclusively post aggressively about Israel on multiple subs, call my comment dumb, thats a good sign. The rise of online peopaganda like that is one of the reasons why we get more laws like these. 

Some of these trolls are so obvious.
  15. Here before the comments get locked
  16. This being needed its both tragic and amazing
  17. Remember, this is only necessary because some people are dumb as rocksüòÇ
  18. With fascism and nazisim being on the rise in Europe (and all around the globe honestly) this is a really good step in the right direction.
  19. I don‚Äôt think criminalizing Holocaust denial in Finland is a good idea. Even though denying the Holocaust is clearly wrong and offensive, making it illegal could threaten freedom of speech. People should be allowed to express their views, even if they‚Äôre ignorant or hateful, because once you start banning opinions, it‚Äôs hard to know where to stop. It also plays into the hands of neo-Nazis and extremists they already argue that if you mention Jews or the Holocaust in a certain way, you get criminalized, but you can still be racist, sexist, or homophobic without facing the same legal consequences. That kind of double standard just gives them more fuel to spread their ideas. It‚Äôs better to educate people and let them make there own opinions
  20. Holocaust denial is very stupid and offensive, but I don't think it should be criminalized. The government should never be in the business of telling citizens what ideas they can express.
  21. Common Finland W. Lfg
  22. Join the club!
  24. I can understand people being concerned about freedom of speech being impeded on, but there are some things that I believe must be protected, it‚Äôs not really about individuals not believing in it, it‚Äôs about misinformation being spread, especially by far-right people who are attempting to spread the lie that the holocaust didn‚Äôt occur, which is a huge dishonour to the victims, their loved ones and the people that fought and died to stop it.

There needs to be legislation to protect the memories of the horrific mass murder, especially because of how vulnerable it is to abuse from neo-Nazis.
  25. Took them long enough. 

This should be the standart for any country. 

We germans can't be the only ones doing this.
  26. Sounds good
  27. Good.
  28. Based finland!
  29. Never forget!
  30. Remember when EU was mocking China...now all you hear from EU lately is: EU ban this...EU ban that ü§Ø
  31. So no freedom of speech to question what the government tells you. I‚Äôm an American who‚Äôs part Ashkenazi jew but I don‚Äôt think any questioning of history should be off limits, even if it‚Äôs our ignorance and bigoted like in this case, as this is a slippery slope which ends in the government overstepping their boundaries and infringing on your rights
  32. Please arrest any visitor from Texas that is a holocaust denier.  I have to believe that Musk makes his way through Finland from time to time.
  33. I'm guessing it's hard to become a Finnish citizen from the US...?
  34. Good job Finland, how on earth is Holocaust denial even a fucking thing? I really don't get how you can deny something that was so well documented. My aunts uncle died in Auschwitz, and people don't realize that WWII and the Holocaust are literally the reason my Grandma's side of the family fled to seek refuge in the US where my Mom and Dad followed their steps after. I could've been born in Poland, but I was born in America instead.
  35. That's actually interesting that they are capable of passing such a law given the history of Finland collaboration with Germany in the 1940s but I honestly applaud them for passing such a basic law that should have been done a while ago
  36. That‚Äôs how you protect truth
  37. I understand there are limits to free speech - and that they are drawn at different lines in different countries -  and I am disgusted by Holocaust deniers, however, I think an individual should be free to say *anything*, short of yelling fire in a crowded theatre, without government punishing that speech.
  38. Not well thought through
  39. Honestly, good. The only idiots out there denying atrocities are the ones looking to commit them again.
  40. Cries in American
  41. What about jizzrali genocide in Palestine denial? Is that included too? Asking for a friend.
  42. It's time to criminalise Gaza genocide denial now.
  43. Why would this even be criminal? Is denying any other atrocity also criminal?
  44. I can see banning the government from denying the holocaust. An individual should have freedom of speech, even if they use it to say heinous shit. The individual should be venerable to civil lawsuits from affected parties as well. 

A smart lawmaker can use banned speech to criminalize unexpected topics in cases like these.

It's like the death penalty. Everyone should be against it, not because killing an evil person is wrong but because giveing the government the power to execute a citizen is foolish.
  45. Be sure to check the profiles of all the free-speech warriors upset by this, you'll find a funny lil' trend.
  46. As long as one's words don't go into incitement or threats, they should be allowed to say any dumb thing they want including things like this.
  47. Okay a question. What about those the "simply do not care" are they going to put them in a time out?
  48. Now criminalize replacing your citizenry with foreign elements that have no intention to integrate.
  49. Good, and i fucking can‚Äôt stand the annoying ass seppos that crawl their way into these comment sections talking about ‚ÄúBuT fReDoOm Of sPeEcH!!!!!!11!!!1!‚Äù 

Europe has suffered from the hands of facism worse than anywhere else. I‚Äôm so sick of this idea of needing to be tolerant for the non-tolerant. Nazis and the holocaust are bad! This is a fact! Its evil, any ‚Äúbuuut‚Äù in my eyes makes you a fucking Nazi.

This shit never needs to be forgotten. This isn‚Äôt some amorphous thing that may lead into a communist takeover where you cant speak your mind. This is making sure this shit never happens again, and if you disagree, then fuck you.
  50. Some comments seem to confuse freedom of speech and freedom of consequence, I think in Finland they probably were thinking a lot about it and as it came to such a decision it is not bad in my opinion. Although my perspective as a German might be a bit different on this topic, I guess.
  52. Americans: Is this a nazi law?
  53. Sending people to jail for 2 years for not believing in the holocaust will not make them believe in the holocaust, it will radicalize them and turn them into Neo-Nazis. Arresting people for thought crimes will always radicalize them. It‚Äôs literally fascism.
  54. Free speech is not a suicide pact. We know that holocaust deniers are not "just asking questions". They're probing our society for confused, emotionally dysregulated individuals they can manipulate, blame everything on "the Jews", open the door to conspiratorial thinking, subvert our social fabric and public trust in government, and ultimately collapse our societies from within.
  55. Ah, out of their nasty holes come the free speech absolutists to defend an idea that got us into all of this shit in the first place
  56. Perussuomalaiset (the Finns‚Äô Party) in shambles
  57. Holocaust did happen. It was absolutely horrific crime against humanity and against the Jews in particular. I would strongly recommend a book by Viktor Frankl ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs search for meaning‚Äù.
  58. Good, every country should.
  59. And now do this for evry atrocity done not just single event in history we ƒÅre equal people all right? Right?¬†
  60. Yup, got to criminalise thoughts we don‚Äôt like!
  61. Thought police
  62. Excellent. It should be EU wide at the very least.
  63. Excellent news! Now let‚Äôs make politicians and public figures accountable for des-informing and miss-informing.
  65. Very very bad , The holocaust happened but this is a gross violation of free speech
  66. Can I move to Finland?
  67. Good.
  68. Can't believe how many idiots are supporting this. How are people so short sighted they can't see how governments take a mile when given an inch?
  69. Everyone who up voted this is ironically supportive of the same kind of authoritarian practices which allowed the Holocaust to occur
  70. Good.
  71. Good!
  72. Holocaust denial is ridiculous, but as with all other speech, that should not be up to the state to dictate. No such thing as reasonable speech controls outside of direct threats of violence.
  73. The best time to do this was right after the Holocaust happened. The second best time is now.
  74. If only the US would
  75. What does this achieve? Policing a thought crime. Anyone who denies the holocaust is just going to use this as further justification as to why they are right as 'the government is covering it up'. People who know the holocaust happened will just continue to, which is the vast vast majority of people.
  76. I think deniers are idiots, but I don‚Äôt support the restriction of speech. This should be protested.
  77. Didn't happen.
  78. Can I deny the existence of this law?
  79. While holocaust denial is wrong, it‚Äôs also wrong to limit free speech and free thought no matter how dumb it is
  80. Countdown until President Musk, Grifter in Chief and JD "Couch Fucker" Vance decry this as death of democracy and us denying "free speech" in 5.......4.....3......2.....
  81. This is just policing speech. 

Free societies don't police speech.
  83. Making speech illegal is not good. The government shouldn't be able to control what words you utter.
  84. this is practically 9/11 for "Anti-Zionists"
  85. Why are we criminalising thoughts?
  86. Holy based
  87. Welcome to the club.
  88. Good
  89. r/goodnews
  90. Hell yes
  91. Fuck yea Finland
  92. That's pretty fucked. People should not be censored regardless of their beliefs. Even if they're stupid like this.
  93. Holocaust denial should be a crime anywhere, Americans are lucky they can spew literal shit out of their mouth and are protected for it. 

Antisemitism on the rise.
  94. This is actually insane. Somebody who denies the holocaust is a psycho but you have to give space for people to have dumb ideas

We just experienced COVID where you were racist if you said it came from China and a crazy person if you said it came from a lab

If somebody yelled it to Jewish people then it should be classed as harassment and/or hate speech
  95. Why not pass a law to criminalize genocide denial? I mean, why just Holocaust? I mean Finnish also care about the genocide of other races right?
  96. Freedom of the self begins there, where the freedom of another ends.

So many people on this sub have such strong opinions on concepts such as freedom, freedom of speech, hatespeech etc without ever having opened a book on ethics

Why don't y'all just go touch some grass and stop embarrassing yourselves online
  97. I'm curious, is it allowed to agree it happened and say "it was a good thing" I mean it's an opinion... do we ban opinions nowadays?
  98. The government should not be in the business of putting handcuffs on you based on speech that isn't an imminent and credible threat to life.
  101. ALL genocide denial should be criminalized

  2. 421 people were the last I heard had been detained. These weren‚Äôt even political protests just May 1st Workers' Day celebrations. Some people were detained simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and erdogan‚Äôs police didn‚Äôt like that.

Many of the detentions were plain violent. Some women were even sexually assaulted by the police.

It just shows how far behind we are when it comes to human rights and democracy unfortunately. Even 5% of what we‚Äôve been experiencing in recent months would cause mass outrage and unrest in democratic parts of Europe like France. We can‚Äôt even go to Taksim Square to protest. How insane is that?
  3. The silence of the EU over this is very loud. Shameful, very shameful, and also against our interest. A democratic Turkey is better for us
  5. At a jail in Turkey a detainee goes to the library and he demands a particular book. He is told that they don't have the book, but they have the author there.
  6. Did you say thank you to all your wonderful compatriots in Germany who voted for this?
  7. I wish the best for the Turkish people protesting. Love and support from Wales üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø‚ù§Ô∏è
  8. What they need is another Kamal Pasha. Turkey needs a renaissance.
  9. Hopefully Turks living abroad who voted for Erdogan can now see what they really voted for, and regret it.
  10. Who ever took that photo congrats. That's a hell of a shot.
  11. No surprise whatsoever.

Turkey is a totalitarian dictatorship masquerading as a "secular democracy".

In reality, Erdogan's Turkey is actually far closer to resembling Iran more than anything else.

Protect your freedom.

Don't visit Turkey.

For any reason.

Next.
  12. This is like a war crime.
  13. No government should fear its people asking for dignity. If they do ‚Äî the problem isn‚Äôt the people
  15. I love Turkey have been there several times such a historic country the people and food are amazing.. it really breaks my heart to see this.
  16. Is there more context
  17. Im not familiar with this situation if anyone wouldn‚Äôt mind clarifying?
  18. It‚Äôs happening in Belgium too. But you‚Äôre all not ready to talk about that.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/1/pro-palestine-activist-arrested-in-belgium-after-attending-protest
  19. Trump: <Heavy breathing intensifies>
  20. Sultan Caliph Erdokunt
  21. Looks like the US
  22. What rights are they protesting for again?
  23. You're only now seeing the dictatorship?
  24. Police in Turkey was never for the people but for the benefit of the state. But we are at a very critical point where the police is not for the state anymore but for one Tyrant.

After getting rid of the Tyrant police force as well as all government employees hired during the Tyrant's reign should be expelled, tried and punished if found guilty of any act against the laws or the people and stripped of all benefits.

Tyrant's men such as in this picture should spend a few decades in prison.
  25. Ardugan is actively fighting and preventing the curdes their freedom and independence and world stands silent
  26. We live in awful times when people vote for tyrans, when tyrans kill people of other countries and no one says a word.
  27. Support from America, where we are also fighting an authoritarian.
  28. Coming soon to a USA near you
  29. Corrupt governments want people to go to the streets and protest. Protests mean nothing to them. It works as a mean for people to release their emotions, plus if at some point they get violent the corrupt government can employ heavy force and educate the rebels on the street. If you want change you have to boycott what supports them and boycott their power and what protects them. Meanwhile people protest corrupt politicians laugh because they know this has no significant impact on them and they can easily control it. Plus once people release their emotions through this everything comes back to normal easily and they have no other way but to accept the new smaller enclosure for them
  30. Stay strong Turks! Erdogan will fall.
  31. Armenia is crazy
  32. Coming soon to America‚Ä¶
  33. In Turkey it's human rights abuse! In Germany it's just following the law! So much faux outrage by people who have no leg to stand on.
  34. We are in a world war. No one wants to admit it. But we are
  35. Long time since any peaceful protest made any change. 
It is either planning on Caeusescu way from the beginning or just better save your life and health, and stay home.
  36. https://youtu.be/M_4uG--_MDg?feature=shared
  37. They‚Äôre growing more desperate except much more violence from the police and maybe even the military if they really desperate¬†
  38. Behind him is Trump, the bigger dictator. This is not limited to Turkey, Orban in Hungary, Modi in India, Putin in Russia, Meloni in Italy, soon Afd in Germany. They are all very close friends of this dictator. After promising people that they will solve their problems and taking power, they turn into monsters who only strive to protect their own power.
  39. That would never happen in America lol üòÇ
  40. This should not happen
  41. Well yeah. They people doing it aren‚Äôt peaceful
  42. US will be like this soon
  43. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  44. 75%
  45. Coming soon to a united state near you!
  46. America is not far off. Give us 6 months!!
  47. Proof that every country is its own. They do what they want to. The world cannot tell any country how to treat their people. It sucks, but it's a fact. My suggestion is to anyone in any nation, protest how you can if you must, but do it in a way that is within the laws of your land. Getting arrested for a call is nothing more than just getting arrested
  48. Coming to the US soon.
  49. Coming soon to the United states
  50. Wasnt NATO the military alliances of liberal democracies? You should get now that the people in power in the West don't care about this if they are "reliable allies", stop living in the delusion that we are "the nice garden" and outside there's "the jungle"
  51. Is this what will happen next in these United States? I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it.
  52. Why are they holding his mouth shut?
  53. Like in European union
  54. Nothing will get better until he's Ceau»ôescu'd.
  55.  nobody have time for that
  56. Solidarity, love and sending best wishes from the UK. We hope the protesting has an effect.
  57. I guess you guys have never seen how the german police treat pro Palestine protesters.

What's that saying about people who live in glass houses?...
  58. No need. Turkey through Meloni becomes a vital member of the newly established European Defence investments and Erdogan will make weapons for Europe. 

All Euro leadership is telling us that it is for Europe‚Äôs interests to shut up and pretend that autocracy in Turkey is not of our business, because we want business with Turkey, despite they don‚Äôt represent the West‚Äôs values. 

Europe is feeding actually the eggs of the snake..
  59. Cops are the thugs of government. The people have rights and if the corset aholes they (supposedly) elected aren‚Äôt going to let them perform then, they also have the right to topple that government.
  60. bro stop crying .. shit like this is happening in England Germany and the Netherlands on a daily basis.. stop virtue signalling and mind your own plate cuz it's full of shit
  61. I would have eaten a finger. You will never forget me.
  62. I was going to guess that was US.
  63. wtf is wrong with this world...........
  64. Why is this happening like all over the world all at once? 

India and Pakistan are potentially about to fight too‚Ä¶ like wtf?
  65. Sounds like the USA right now too¬†
  66. I'm afraid nothing good will come out of Turkiye anymore. It's too deep in corruption. Too deep in shit. It's choking in a not-so slow rate. We are merely spectators. No revolutions, no fresh starts, the flow won't have its ebb. Countries can and will perish and the history is full of them. No silver lining in this. Everyday is worse than the previous, and it has been like that for years. No change in sight, or hope.

I am very and truly sorry. I do as a human being still carry some hope that I find irrational and emotional.
  67. My fellow Americans, look at our future.
  68. Fuck it. Overthrow the whole damn planet at this point.
  69. We could use some help over here to, and some help probably over there, and some help round over that way‚Ä¶.shit is fucked.
  70. Demanind basic right? Where is the news coming from. News networks will write anything and people will believe it. 
I guess we are doomed.
  71. What rights are they missing? Not bait or anything, I'm just unfamiliar with the issues.
  72. This is America now too
  73. Well turkey sucks. And Europe what are rights?  Do yall even have any? Anymore. When you get arrested for posting memes calling your leaders worthless and useless. You are just stating facts.
  74. I genuinely thought this was another kid at a US university  using free speech.
  75. What is happening to the world right now?
  76. Are you sure that you‚Äôre not talking about the USA?
  77. Remember when the hateful turkey people attacked our American marines..
  78. Take notes America, this is what you have coming unless you rise up soon
  79. America pretty soon
  80. Well since they're not Palestinians maybe the world will step in
  81. Jesus what is this? America?
  82. There will never be a song in any country called ‚ÄúF@@k the Fire Department‚Äù.  They‚Äôre all the same jackbooted thugs around the world.  ALL of them.
  83. Lol... Imagine we were invaded by some foreign country every time things went a bit sideways in the US.
  84. At least they are not being deported to a foreign country.
  85. They‚Äôre doing the same in Germany
  86. Damn mega is spreading everywhere.
  87. the usa in about 6 months
  88. Ohhh now its a problem. But when they're killing Armenians its ok.
  89. Europe never had free speech idk why anyone is surprised
  90. And in the üá∫üá∏ 

Fri is country in the world my ass !! 

üñïüèº donald DUMP üí©
  91. This is happening in America too, only worse
  92. What a powerful and yet sad picture
  93. We have this in the US too.
  94. When does morality kick in?
  95. Guess you never heard of American cops!!
  96. Gonna happen here in the USA under tRUMP and his SS/Gestapo DOJ!
  97. Fuck the world is going to shit .
  98. Keep on fighting, Turkey. take notes on what is unfolding here
  99. Ottoman Empire attempting a comeback
  100. Goddamn...¬† ¬†Fascism has taken over the world hasn't it?
  101. But none of the countries in the NATO alliance will say shit because the only way for Russian ships to get in and out of the Black Sea is through Turkey. So the enemy of your enemy is your friend, no matter what.
  102. Today Turkey , Tommorrow USA.  üò°
  103. Awesome
  104. Do we really have to see every country and their bs. We have enough of our own in fill in the blank county. Reddit is getting boring
  105. Erdogan‚Ä¶ Trump‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all the same. Social media drives this evil I fear.
  106. Fight the Right wherever they appear! The U.S., Turkey, Hungary, everywhere!! They won‚Äôt be satisfied until we are all under their boots.
  107. Just looking at the picture, I thought this was USA.
  108. All whilst turkey are blasting tourism ads on tv ( in my country) - get fucked.
  109. That happens in Germany and other countries too
  110. Why do police cover peoples mouth during arrest,

isn't it good enough to have them all pinned and cuffed?

Actual question, seems unnecessary, unless I am missing something
  111. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but most of the rest of the world would do that to somebody for demanding their basic civil rights too ... To though I doubt the Arab Emirates are the worst right now.
  112. The united states will not stand for this we...uh wait a minute that was the old US...
  113. United States here, we have our own fascist to deal with‚Ä¶
  114. The authoritarians of the world are banking on the people remaining mostly docile. History tells us that this never really works out.
  115. I'm not surprised, I saw what they did in kurdistan
  116. Turkey is a dictatorship.  Very sad.
  117. We need to raise our voices around the globe. Turkey is under the thumb of a serious piece of shit. The world needs to push back against all dictators? I see momentum here in USA but not enough. We have no clue how bad it can be. I stand with all people being oppressed.
  118. Thought this was about America for a second.
  119. Despots are trying their hardest to overthrow the world order
  120. Society as we know it is collapsing everywhere.
  121. AC Revelations all over again haha
  122. Turkeys government does have a history of not caring about human rights. Ask the Armenians.
  123. I didn't see any details in the comments. So who, what ,when ,where and how?
  124. Is it Thursday again?
  125. The world is getting so much more aggressively authoritarian.  I am very scared where this leads
  126. Turkey, Merica, kinda the same, no?
  127. This is my surprised face‚Ä¶
  128. Police state
  129. Coming to a state Capitol near you
  130. ü§£
  131. Coming to America right now.
  132. Make Turkey secular again.
  133. Got our own problems.
  134. What rights ?
  135. Our administration is probably taking notes and making plans - Good luck from the USA
  136. STOP!


Well, I tried.
  137. Question becomes , what happens to the rest of the world when the society, WE THE PEOPLE    also becomes   ,, I THE PERSON... does it give more to the evil side knowing that the good has moved over many steps to that side ??
  138. American republicans taking notes
  139. Hmm sounds like everyone has that problem nowadays, get in line.
  140. Coming soon to the US
  141. Not America so piss off
  142. It is up to the citizens of Turkey to shut this shit down.
  143. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  144. Peaceful people don‚Äôt have to be arrested like that
  145. Looks like what‚Äôs happening here in the good old USA to me. I guess a rose is a rose by any other name.
  146. Hey liberals in US. Take notes. This is tyranny üòÇüòÇüòÇ
  147. This will be the United States as well, soon. Erdogan is afraid...and he should be
  148. shalom
  149. Are we sure he won't basic rights?And that's it? Are we sure he's a legal citizen?
  150. Who is surprised by this? *Golfclap* 

Average Turkey Politic/Police shit
  151. Typical turkish shit now you guys know how we armenians feel in turkey!
  152. Europe which breaths human rights and preach all , choose to ignore turkey.so bigoted standards.
  153. It‚Äôs getting to the point where every citizen of the world needs to start standing up against tyranny and fascism.
  154. Skill issue
  155. Source?
  156. Remember Hong Kong.  They did warn the world.  I guess we were too busy with Instagram and tik tok to pay any attention.
  157. We'll be seeing this in the next few months. USA USA USSR
  158. Wonder what is peaceful!
  159. Sad to say that I did not know if this was in the US or not.
  160. Remember when they killed a bunch of Armenians? We should have talked for that too.
  161. Keep fighting !!
  162. Happening in America too
  163. Aw ya. Samesies.
  164. World tension is increasing. The times of contempt is here.
  165. Nothing will happen. europe needs erodan to keep their wage slaves in order.
  166. Coming soon to a United States near you.
  167. Guess Trump will be doing this next?
  168. Really thought this was going to be yet another article about the US. Sad that so many countries have crazed despots for leaders, to the point that headlines only need to [insert country name here], without changing anything else.
  169. Please stop protesting without an exit strategy. Protect yourself and those around you, fight as a group.
  170. Did Turkey ever replaced their government through elections?
  171. Erdogan has been ruling with iron fist for at least 10 years and there's no sing of him being replaced
  172. This photo is worth of a Pulitzer.
  173. Context? Without opinion... just like actual quotes without the bullshit?
  174. Remember Hong Kong? I do. We have an awful development worldwide of fascism.
  175. Thats horrible also they detained 450 people on may 1
  176. I'd stick my tongue out..Cop wouldn't dare put his hand on my face again.
  177. So the whole world is melting down? We have the orange giant and his minions to deal with here.
  178. What basic right are they protesting for?
  179. Hey!!! World!!!! Why??!!!
  180. Same is happening in USA!!
  181. Damn we just have 2 hands to rise and there's so much that happen
  182. I hate breathing the same air with the people who do this barbarity and who have it done.
  183. Interesting how Erdogan is getting a lot of stick on r/europe since he started openly condemning the genocide in Gaza. Not saying that r/europe  is full of Israeli bots, but you do wonder ...
  184. Erdoƒüan‚Äôs soldiers.
  185. Sending love and support from Denmark üá©üá∞‚ô•Ô∏è
  186. I bet they're regretting stopping that coup now.
  187. Yeah those Arabs and Islamic peoples in Turkey must pay the price. Their religion is the cause. They have very prohibitve culture. I wish death upon its citizens.
  188. Looks like here
  189. Trump, Netanyahu, Orban, Putin, and Milei are all smiling seeing this.
  190. I don‚Äôt see any possibility of change happening. Erdogan dealt with opposition leaders and there is no one to oppose him. With the ‚Äúcoup‚Äù years ago he had the army reorganised and filled with yes-man and the people with arms and power are on his payroll unfortunately.
  191. Shits getting wild everywhere. Let‚Äôs focus on our own problems.
  192. Erdogan the worst dictator who locks up his opponents and journalists!
  193. Turkey, the USA, Hongary. Vote a populist get a tyrant
  194. Bet those thugs feel like such big men beating on people
  195. I just wonder how they can explain this (as a teenage in Turkey sadly i know that they will not even talk about ts)
  196. one three one two
  197. this is sad
  198. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad. Every country is bad.
  199. What a horrifying world we live in.
  200. And these tyrants are in NATO?

=== POST #15 ===
**Title:** ICE Imprisons Danish Dad of 4 at Citizenship Interview: The former foreign exchange student, now married to an American with U.S. citizen children, has spent over a month in a rural Louisiana detention facility.
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 38889
**Comments (133):**
  1. You left out the detail that this guy is a Trump fan. (This story has already been posted to r/LeopardsAteMyFace)
  2. He, his wife and her family are Trump supporters, they were likely very much onboard with the intimidation and detention of people deemed to be foreign or an "alien threat"; they just assumed by nature of his skin tone the husband would be immune to any possible repercussions.
  3. Well, dude, your wife voted for this...
  4. They voted for this and now they are begging online for money.

Amazing.
  5. Well deserved, they can keep him there.

Best regards from Denmark.
  6. Bwahaahh! All he and his wife post is pro-trump anti-vax rubbish. Glorious to see, hopefully he goes to El Salvador like he wished for so many others.
  7. Couldn't have happened to a greater guy
  8. I thought she said on facebook that they cant get her lawyer to get info because he‚Äôs not even processed so there‚Äôs no dossier to get to a judge. So he‚Äôs physically in detention but on paper he‚Äôs not even there. So the system can‚Äôt even get him out. (Saw this from another post) LOOOOOOOOOL

No sympathy. We don‚Äôt even know how many people are detained already and where they are. At least the germans were good at paperwork
  9. Don't travel to the USA until Trump is gone. Not worth the risks.
  10. His family voted for this. He is a HUGE Trump fan. He got exactly what he wanted.
  11. trump:  I'll release him as soon as you give me Greenland....
  12. As a former exchange student from the US to France, I cannot comprehend why anyone from Europe would want to move to the US or spend any extended amount of time here - especially Louisiana of all places. 

Even before all this MAGA crap started living in this expensive as hell, unjust, idiotic shopping mall hellscape still sucked. It is so much worse knowing firsthand what it's like living somewhere civilized
  13. >¬†Verite News¬†wrote that detainees at the privately run facility

And just like that, we know the real motivation begin its incarceration.

The fact that he is a trumptard is just icing on the shitcake.
  14. He is lucky he did not end up on a plane to Africa that disappeared, or in El Salvador from where even the supreme court can't get you back...
  15. So he was here legally

He has broken no laws

He has a family

And he was becoming a citizen legally

How about deporting Ivanka then, or JD Vance's in laws

Considering they dont seem to care what type of immigrant you are one way or the other
  16. And that's why nobody should risk visiting America for the foreseeable future.
  17. Oh the anti-immigration Trump supporter has been detained by ICE? Let me play for him a song on the world's smallest violin
  18. Don't worry about him, he's a MAGA supporter  and clearly liked the idea that only people with darker skin were going to be deported
  19. EU citizens should avoid travel to Russia, the US, North Korea and Belarus due to the agressive attitude of those regimes to the EU.
  20. Fuck them. They‚Äôre getting what they voted for¬†
  21. Land of the free.....
  22. As an international student I studied at an American university. Sure glad I didn‚Äôt choose to stay.
  23. As a Dane I was first full of outrage for him, but then I kept reading. Whatever the so called miscommunication is. Karma got to him!
  24. He was arrested cause he didn't do his paperwork properly. When you are in a marriage GC your residence is tied to the marriage for the first 3 years and you are required to apply for the removal the conditional after.

Failing to file Form I-751, the Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence, within the 90-day period before the expiration of your conditional green card can lead to the loss of your permanent resident status and potentially removal from the United States. While you can still file the I-751 late, you must demonstrate "good cause" for the delay to be excused.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

Consequences of Failing to File on Time:

Loss of Permanent Resident Status:

If you fail to file the I-751 within the required timeframe, you will automatically lose your permanent resident status.

Removal Proceedings:

You may be placed in removal proceedings (deportation) and become deportable.
  25. According to facebook post in 2015 he had a "visa miscommunication" which probably means he committed a visa fraud and now got caught.

Its somewhat nice to know Trump's ICE at least do not discriminate and round up all illegals. No idea what this family expected.
  26. Most people, relative naive think, they vote for a little more  conservatism when they vote right wing. They don\`t understand, that these elections we\`re facing  in the West are nothing of the kind before. It\`s a choice of a new system. Antidemocratic, no individual rights except for the newborn king.  
Idiots, psychopaths, all sorts of people that never had a voice become ministers,secretaries  and presidents.

We had that in 1933 when even quite a few jews voted for the Nazis...

I don\`t feel sorry any more for this much stupidity. Because they are not  only naive. They think of themselves as  good people, but  in reality  they are cruel, ruthless and criminals - now  with  the blessing  of a  bigot religion.
  27. As a fellow dane, good, fuck this trump supporting POS.
  28. I keep saying we need a Herman Cain style sub to collect these stories for posterity!

As in Trump supporters and right-wing cunts end up on receiving end of what they wanted for other people.
  29. They‚Äôre trump supporters LOOOOOOOL get fucked cunts
  30. I keep saying this to my British friends over there 
Get out now, because its only going to get worse
  31. Sanction the US.

Travel ban.

Whatever is needed to stop this madness.
  32. Excellent. He got what he voted for.
  33. He was KIDNAPPED by an organized criminal enterprise. No other explanation would be appropriate.
  34. It sounds like she voted for this, she just didn‚Äôt realize white immigrants count as immigrants. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll get her husband back and get to keep a fat gofundme though, bc that‚Äôs just how the US works now. Evil wins.¬†
  35. but he‚Äôs white!
  36. I just don't see the United States making it out of this as a single country.
  37. For the love of God.

Stop. Going. To. The. States.

It's no longer worth the risk of a border agent using an anti Trump post in 2017 to fulfil his quota.
  38. So sad, that he threw away his heritage to become an AMERICAN!¬†
  39. I would tell him to bring his family to Europe but he's a Trumpist so we shouldn't let them in.
  40. I am a dual citizen living in Europe and there is a reason I am not bringing my family to the US right now. I just cant trust the authorities.
  41. So, punk, I have two versions of habeas corpus, one in each hand. One is from the Constitution, the other is from Kristi Noem. You choose, are you feeling lucky?
  42. We literally dropped our plans for a 3-week holiday to the US because of this shit.
  43. This is happening because Russia interfered in our politics. 

If you don't want this to happen in your country, then you need to do something about Russia before it's too late.
  44. For the love of god, keep him there
  45. My wife is Japanese. Her green card expired last year and we sent in all her paperwork to renew it. We got a letter saying it was "good" for a few more years while they process her case.

We're still in Japan and refuse to return to the US because of crap like this. It would not surprise me if they stopped her at the border or came after her later. Even if she had her card, we're still worried since no one is safe.
  46. hope he thanked them afterwards
  47. FTFY: Illegal immigrant Maga supporter is arrested for being an illegal immigrant
  48. It's been happening for a long time.

A friend of mine (New Zealand) was imprisoned for 6 months unable to access a lawyer, or communicate with his American born wife. She was the only life line and was able to get him released from prison eventually. They moved away from the US.
  49. How can people be happy about this is beyond me. Yes it happened to person who basically voted for it but I cant bring myself being happy or "gotcha" about this. I dont get it around here sometimes.
  50. Reddit is a funny place. You can think this guys family is idiotic for being magas and still feel sympathy that someone is rotting in a detention facility with no due process. Reminds me of when people were celebrating the deaths of the unvaxxed people.
  51. So how many Europeans are excited about the next world cup and will make the trip to the US to attend?
  52. Don't forget the cool 1 million that GEO Group donated to Make America Great Again Inc. to make this happen and get this rolling.
  53. Yeah, after reading he was and still is a Trump supporter, I don't feel bad for him anymore. He voted for this, let him have the consequences. A shame he gets attention while anyone with a darker skin colour gets next to none, even though they face a similar situation.
  54. If he is a Trump supporter than I have no pity for him. He supports the leopards who are now eating his face.
  55. I hope he gets his American citizenship. Trumpism and MAGA are so utterly incompatible with Danish values and norms, we should be glad when people like him choose to self-quarentine.
  56. thats what happens when you go to a uncivilized country
  57. Karma is a bitch buhahaha
  58. Just another day in the USA
  59. Den n√¶ste far til fire bliver vild
  60. So a Danish Trumper fucked around and then found out
  61. Also a massive Trump fan and anti-vaxxer.
  62. He was an immigrant who was in favour of anti-immigrant rhetoric? Come on man. You saw the leopard, you saw it eating faces, you supported the leopard eating faces and then offered your face to the leopard.
  63. Trump support aside, it's pretty stupid that this guy was literally following the legal process to gain citizenship and they arrested him for being a non-citizen. So in reality all forms of immigration or even tourism are now illegal
  64. So he lied on his paperwork and people are upset about ICE detaining him?
  65. No idea why people visit that country
  66. Well deserved, traitor!

  67. "I'm too white to be a target" ass bozo. He supported Trump, which honestly makes him a traitor to America AND Denmark. Fafo.
  68. The fact that nowhere in the article is the "paperwork error" explained by the wife tells me that he lied at some point.
  69. As an American Trans Woman, genuinely stay the hell away from the USA for the foreseeable future. It is just not worth it or safe right now. 

Colonialism infected early America, and that morphed into the Confederacy, which morphed into Jim crow and Imvaded Germany in the form of the Nazis, before being being imported back to the USA and combined with Jim Crow to create Conservativism, which has now seized the government here and weilds the department of homeland security as modern day brownshirts.

Stay the eff out and save any friends y'all can, I think it's about to get bad.
  70. He looks like your typical White American man.
  71. "Maybe it can happen to us aswell" - MAGA White people in some other timeline
  72. History repeats??

First they came for the Communists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Communist
Then they came for the Socialists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Socialist
Then they came for the trade unionists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a trade unionist
Then they came for the Jews
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Jew
Then they came for me
And there was no one left
To speak out for me
  73. Sounds like true freedom to me
  74. I will never step foot to the US again.
  75. O.O 
üíö 
I very much love that for him. That's exactly the behavior what this dude wanted from ICE and other police force. ü§£

r/LeopardsAteMyFace/
  76. > She said she homeschools their children and that they raise animals on a ranch.

> asking those in the community to pray

Sounds like she voted for Trump
  77. Guess who's going to be used as a pawn over Greenland?
  78. Why??? Can we please stop this ridiculous bullshit. Vote these MF s out in November. Let's get Trump impeached and put an end to this shit show.
  79. Well at least they‚Äôre not being racist. Only virulently xenophobic üò≥

AND they‚Äôre MAGA?!! My schadenfreude is red-lining.
  80. As a European,theres no force on Earth or Heaven which will force to even visit US under that orange fascist fucktard.
  81. Finding it tremendously hard to have sympathy here. I mean, he and the wife are Trumpists, card-carrying members of the Leopards will eat my face party and this is only an issue because it's affecting them.
  82. I was enraged for a minute but he‚Äôs a Trump supporter, this is exactly what he voted for

Edit:

As I think about this, part of me does feel bad for him. Even though he was blind and shortsighted as to vote for a man who we all saw doing exactly this does that mean him and his family deserve to suffer? Does to be ignorant mean to be worthy of pain and hardship? If you were tricked by evil does that mean you don‚Äôt deserve good? 

I said I don‚Äôt feel bad, but I do. I don‚Äôt want anyone to suffer, even if they were ignorant enough to ask for the thing that brought the suffering. I‚Äôve brought suffering on myself, did I deserve the pain it brought?
  83. Everyone is focusing on who it is and not the craziness of arresting someone as they go through the legal process for staying...
  84. No need for deporting him to Denmark, let someone pardon him and let him stay. A MAGA faithful isn‚Äôt what I want back to Denmark.
  85. This is what he actively, with his whole chest, voted for.
  86. but, he's white, heterosexual and a man.... what's wrong?
  87. He genuinely wanted this, so it's hard to have too much sympathy with him, but it is a stark reminder that no one is safe. You are only as protected as the most vulnerable person in your community, and no matter of skin color or affiliation can save you from it, which is why you should still fight for their rights even if you're one of those people who are incapable of thinking of anyone but yourself.
  88. Thoughts and prayers.
  89. Couldn‚Äôt be happier for him and his family.  They got exactly what they voted for.
  90. What a shithole country the orange man is destroying.
  91. ICE had quotas at the time of the arrest. This is why they're going after decades old paperwork errors.
  92. Ok there is a lot of bashing on this guy for being a Trump supporter, but reading the article is pretty f‚Äôed up. He had a green card since 2013, married a US citizen and had children here. How in the world was he arrested by ICE all of those things considered?
  93. >detainees at the privately run facility have observed rodent droppings on kitchen surfaces and human excrement in a shower area

Yet another low effort private company prison. There are so many of those.
  94. It‚Äôs a terror campaign.
  95. President Bumblefuck will release him, but you know what we need first, DON‚ÄôT you, Denmark??
  96. But, but, their white. That no maga sense.
  97. Consequences.
  98. The fact that he is born in Denmark is not really a relevant parameter.
  99. So white, so blonde, so masculine, such a Trump supporter. Didn't anyone get the memo?

I had a run in with US immigration many years ago due to them putting the wrong stamp on my passport when I first entered the country. I was on military exchange and worked as an officer at a joint command unit. I had a US military ID.

I spent a whole day at an immigration office geting lectures on how inconvenient this was for them, what a waste of time I was causing them. Due to advice from my workmates I 'yes ma'am', 'sorry ma'am', 'really appreciate what you're doing ma'am', all day as the most poisonous bully of a women made sure I knew who was boss and how beholden to her I was. Most petty, power tripping bureaucrat I've ever had the misfortune to meet.
  100. And without habeas corpus, the man would be just gone.
  101. So the party of traditional family values likes breaking up families.  Also this guy trumps so fuck him
  102. Tell World Cup not to come . It will be dangerously stupid.
  103. But why was he detained? Was he lawfully or unlawfully - in retrospect - detained?
  104. It is the Republican way. Can someone check Rubio and Cruz lineage great possibility they could fall under the new guidelines for a 12:01 flight to ? I will buy a rump watch if they take Desantis too.
  105. \#AbolishICE
  106. Anyone still wondering why nobody wants to travel to the US?
  107. Hey, Europeans, it's *totally* safe to come here during the World Cup!!  /s
  108. Blonde haired and blue eyed too.  Someone in ICE is in trouble.
  109. Hey what about Elon Musk overstayed his visa for six month back in the day?
  110. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting raked over the coals about this South Africa thing! Go arrest a white guy! ‚Äú
  111. Hes aslo a Trump supporter so he got exactly what he wanted and i hope he gets a swift deportation. May he forever be blacklisted from returning.
  112. Is he a criminal? There's this massive assumption that these are all innocent humans.
  113. Have the day you voted for!
  114. Actually surprised this is a white guy...
  115. This is crazy as hell to me because early on I was asking what could potentially happen to my FIL who is a green card holding Canadian, married to an American, with 2 American born children. 

Also a huge trump fan.
  116. They looked at a picture of themselves and decided they were safe.

Fascists always eat their own.
  117. He got what he voted for. How lucky of him üòÄ
  118. Hold k√¶ft en jubel idiot. De m√• gerne beholde ham s√• l√¶nge det lyster üòÇ
  119. Oh no, the consequences of their own actions by voting for this. Couldn't have happened to a nicer family.
  120. How do you say goodbye in Danish?
  121. The US is a failed state. DO NOT COME HERE AND SPEND MONEY.
  122. This won't change their view, they will be angry and upset they got caught up in this because of "paperwork" but continue to support Trump and his administration tactics despite knowing how devastating this is to families.
  123. Why does he get a cushy detention facility? Why not El Salvador? Because he is white?
  124. Trump supporter that once called Democrats "Satan."

Fuck Around and Find Out. Don't feel bad for him at all.

I do, however, think he should be released because this is wrong and i'm not a Fascist.
  125. Trump is a fucking Nazi.  

We in America fucking hate him.  He will cause another world war.  We will have to deal with Nazis again
  126. I read a blurb somewhere that mentioned that he was on a conditional green card that was good for two years. 

He apparently neglected to have the conditions removed, so the green card was null and void after two years. 

In a normal administration, this would probably just be a paperwork issue and a meeting or two with officials to confirm that he's still married to the same woman, gainfully employed and that's that. 


Now, this is what happens.
  127. Fk ICE and Fk Trump
  128. See? We‚Äôll do white people too
  129. This guy should get sent to Sudan. I mean he supported this, couldn't vote yet but was pro Trump.
  130. What if he lost his job ? Will ice paid him due compensation? 

What a waste of public resources
  131. This is wild! I went to highschool with them in Starkville high. They were both in my drama class and that's where they met. When I saw a picture of them on my reddit feed. I was so surprised. And, guess what! The wife is full maga too.
  132. That's a heartbreaking situation. A man who's built a life and family in the U.S. going through the proper channels to become a citizen ends up detained during what should‚Äôve been a milestone moment. It raises serious questions about how immigration policies are being enforced, especially when families and kids are directly affected
  133. I can't afford to throw my phone at the wall anymore.

**Title:** Blackout in Barcelona
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 37954
**Comments (103):**
  1. Same thing here in Portugal. People rushed straight to the bars to rescue all the beer. Glad to see that in both sides of Iberia we care about our planet and are committed to no waste
  2. if you zoom in on the first table on the right, you can see people pooling their coins together to pay, because the card readers don't work.
  3. Uff I was on a train from Barcelona to Madrid this morning. All of the sudden, the train stopped. We sat there for about 4 hours until they towed us to the nearest station, sat there until 22:00, and now I‚Äôm at a Red Cross camp in the sports center of Guadalajara. Imagine 600 people in a tiny train station in the middle of nowhere with no food, minimal water, no phone service, and no clue what‚Äôs going on.
  5. Well, nice day for it anyway.
  6. finally, forced  to "touch the grass"
  7. Looks surprisingly comfy for a blackout, at least in this particular scene. Take care Spaniards!
  8. Why hasn't anybody commented yet that in the area with no electricity there is likely to be a baby-boom in exactly 9 months...
  9. I bet in a weird way, as long as you know everybody's safe, it's quite blissful.
  10. If anything, they look like they are having just another wholesome day outside. The Spaniards and the Portuguese are admirable.
  11. A year ago, I was in Kyiv and due to the war we also had power outages lasting over 5 hours. It wasn‚Äôt a good situation especially since it kept happening over and over. At that time, I bought power banks: one with 500W and another with 2.4kW which allowed me to basically ignore the outages (There haven‚Äôt been any blackouts for quite a while now, so they‚Äôve just been sitting unused). That‚Äôs why I recommend getting a power bank too, because it can really help you stay protected during blackouts, especially in a hot climate. Feel free to DM me if you want advice
  12. And not a single cellphone in sight. People actually talking to each others
  13. the American mind can't comprehend this
  14. I was a part of the US east coast blackout in the early Aughts. I was like 20 and it was so wild and terrible but we also kind of all came together and had some fun in that mess.
  15. No phones. Nice üëç
  16. Average afternoon at Pla√ßa del Sol, nothing special. On Fridays there's a lot more people.
  17. Forced Internet detox
  18. Looks like a normal summer afternoon in Spain
  19. Was power restored? Or is it still an issue?
  20. would be interesting to look at the birth rate statistics in 8-10 months.
  21. ‚ÄúNot a single person looking at their phone. Those were the days‚Äù
  22. Not a cellphone in sight, just people living in the moment.
  23. Genuine question, would this area normally be this crowded on a nice day? Or is this merely a byproduct of this blackout?
  24. All fridges are down. Hospitals? Care homes? Crime? Its a bad thing
  25. touching ~~grass~~ pavement
  26. Forcing people to become social again. Terrible /s
  27. Barcelona wins.
  28. My brother in Madrid did the same üòÇ
  29. The sweetness of a casual get together in a Mediterranean city ‚ù§Ô∏è
  30. We call it Loadshedding here in South Africa. Enjoy!
  31. And that‚Äôs how the government fixed the demographic crisis, in 9 months the blackout baby boom! ¬†
  32. The night was so so quiet! When I always crave the quiet, no noise from tvs, people, electric devices like fridges which are outside. This time I had a hard time to fall asleep because I was nervous about it all. But it was actually amazing to have this much quiet.


Talking of food, all the meats, cheeses, yoghurts are gone! I am not eating any meat for at least a week ha. Only grains, veggies, fruits.
  33. TIL Woody is in Barcelona
  34. Fun huh? Unless your loved one is in the hospital....
  35. How long will it last? Might be a great opportunity for amazing astrophotography images taken right in Barcelona
  36. My hart  skipped a beat the moment I've noticed the picture.   

I've recognized  Pla√ßa del Sol, instantly. I am most certain i am correct as I have the image of this location printed on my cortex.  

I visited this neighborhood 4 years in a row while they were celebrating Festa Mejor de Gr√†cia. This are some great memories that i will never forget.  

 Under the balcony situated in the background of the  picture  I've had the occasion to admire a *castell*. It impressed me in a very profound manner.   

I absolutely love the spirit of the Spanish people and admire their attitude towards life.  Cheers to you guys!
  37. Do not: use internet shutdowns to slow protests and silence dissent of authoritarian regimes.

Do: use internet shutdowns to show people that social media is driving society crazy with loneliness.
  38. Nice day. I really want to go back to Europe.
  39. This is life without smart phones alot more united and social
  40. My local kebab guy gave me a pair of free pitas for me and my bf bc I didn't have cash and came straight from uni. We sat on the grass in some field, ate, drew tattoos all over our legs with our school supplies, drew on our notebooks and when we got bored we went to his home, napped and then played board games

I'm super grateful that people didn't panic and everyone was so chill and civic about it
  41. I was there last year and I think half of them wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't gone on for so long.
  42. maybe we can start a new trend now, every 2nd weekend the electricity is stopped - you get people talking, doing stuff, not looking at their phones or hooked on Netflix...
  43. Very little random violence, attempts at shagging and vomiting, oh, *that* kind of blackout...
  44. Finally, people are touching grass and socializing again üòå
  45. Reverse pandemic.
  46. Gonna be alot of babies in 9 months
  47. Look at that scene of carnage!!
  48. And this is why abandoning the physical money is just plain stupid
  49. People actually being forced to look another in the eye and... \*shivers\* talk? Socialize? Inconceivable!
  50. isn't that l'auberge espagnole
  51. Reverse Covid
  52. Damn I miss living there, still my favorite city.
  53. I remember reading somewhere that neighborhoods that had more community spaces had lower rates of death during power failures, which were mostly older people alone without ac. If they regularly had a park or community spaces to hang out in they were more able to get out of the house and more likely for people to check on them
  54. The only good thing this year and only Spain and Portugal gets a piece of the pie!!?
  55. And no one missed any work.
  56. This reminds me of the blackout in Toronto in the early 2000s or late 90s. I forget. Good times and memories made. I hope you‚Äôre making the best of it and you‚Äôve been able to get by without any harm being done.
  57. No phones

Looks like a pic taken in the 80s
  58. About an hour later, there was an impromptu concert going on in that plaza. Wonderful day at Pla√ßa del Sol.
  59. God damn it. Now i want a black out. There's something beautiful about everything grinding to a halt.
  60. Not one person explaining or talking about the reason. Fck this rtard continent. What‚Äôs coming for us seems to be self-inflected‚Ä¶
  61. Honestly this pic isn't too far out of the norm from a typical day in Spain.  I miss Spain.
  62. Whenever it's 20 degrees Celsius or more outside here in the Netherlands this is the common picture even during working weekdays so at first I was like.. "someone posts a random picture of them being outside". Then I read about the power outage and thought "Guess there are less people outside as usual as some people can't pay now"
  63. Nice vibes I have to say
  64. Prime example of why a cashless society is destined for failure
  65. It is nice seeing no phones around and everyone in the moment. Reminds me of when I was a kid!
  66. Seems lovely!
  67. That girl laying down dead on the left is my spirit animal.
  68. in america people would be looting and doing ghetto shit.
  69. 9 months from now hospitals will be unusually busy.
  70. [Lunch is usually something cool like a cigarette, two three bottle red wine and like a bowl of heavy cream ](https://youtu.be/1YCOT5LasKc?si=jKeH5A0C1GUey_EE)
  71. crazy big difference in a tropical country. Right now, it's consistent 40deg C outside so if a black out occurs here, people will just have to stay indoors and use manual fans to ensure ventilation and avoid heatstroke
  72. the ensalada Rusa tapa was unbothered by this blackout as it was never chilled anyway lol
  73. Ladies and gentlemen, you can stay here as long as you want. But no more cool beer because the cooler isn't working.
  74. Why is reddit blocking all these posts related to this news?
  75. accidental renaissance
  76. Looks like the perfect area for an 8 lane highway, not being used for anything, people just sitting around enjoying themselves
  77. Which street is this in Barcelona?
  78. Just one cellphone in the picture and that on the table. How beautiful
  79. People got a true holiday
  80. Fortunately there's enough sun on Pla√ßa del Sol. Lovely lil' square.
  81. We are taking electricity for granted and hard to believe how we would manage as species in case of major crisis
  82. must be so nice to hang out without any phones and just enjoy life with your friend and family
  83. Nature is healing
  84. Looks like 1995. Brilliant social experiment‚Ä¶
  85. I see people running in panic, looting shops.
  86. Beautiful! We should do 1 blackout a week to save energy and also socialize more!
  87. That‚Ä¶ looks fun almost
  88. It looks like it was 30 years ago. People are talking to each other and even reading books! No one with a mobile phone!
  89. 21 degrees and everyone wearing long pants, sometimes two shirts. I would be in shorts and a tank top and still sweating my swedish ass off.
  90. looks like life before smart phones
  91. Any apocalypse or end-of-society-as-we-know-it event would look like this in Spain. We don't give a f\* as long as we have our bars and "terracitas".
  92. Ohh so all we need is to cut off mobile communications to get people to come out again?üòã
  93. All I keep thinking about is the amount of frozen food that has to be disposed of................

Edit; Grammar Correction
  94. must be nice in many ways. People come together, I think we all much of this. I do for sure.
  95. Looks like absolute paradise
  96. Walmart Americans see this and call it communism
  97. Conservative parties and news media: "There is chaos in the streets! You have to bring out the army!"

People in Espa√±ita: "I mean, as long as the beer stays cold..."
  98. I actually admire how peaceful it is in this photo considering there is a blackout. If that was America and this picture was taken in LA during a blackout it would be murder and violence
  100. Next time Southern Europeans complain about the heat remember this scene. If this blackout happened here today in Northern Scandinavia we would all be inside bundled up infront of our fireplaces trying to stay alive.
  101. r/AccidentalRenaissance
  102. Hahaha I am in this picture. It was actually a great day, very odd but it took you briefly to a different world and I enjoyed it a lot. Later this same plaza plaza was packed and there was live music from some locals. Incredible time.
  103. no looting

  4. Ugh this is beyond digusting.
  5. My perspective as an Italian.  
  
 We didn't have a trial, we didn't have a reckoning with our fascist history. Both for the sake of peace and out of fear of communism, the decision was made to sweep everything under the carpet and start again. The fact is that you can still be born a fascist in Italy. A large part of the population has never accepted the fall of fascist Italy and believes in a glorious past made possible by mussolini. The reality is very different, and anyone who has studied a bit knows that. But the problem is that in schools, and more generally in the media, fascism is glossed over. You see a lot of films in which Nazis are the bad guys, but films in which Fascists are the bad guys are much rarer. If a professor at school says something against fascism, then they say they are a communist spreading lies. Basically, no matter what evidence you can give, the fascist part of Italy sees it as a lie. They believe that fascist Italy was heaven on earth and that Italy was respected internationally when mussolini was in power, even though it is really far from the truth.

In Italy today there is still a huge divide in the population. The civil war, which we didn't resolve, has been passed on to the new generations. All the right-wing political parties reject every year the celebration of 25 April, the day on which we celebrate the end of nazifascism in Italy. "Bella Ciao", a song associated with the resistance against fascism, is despised by right-wing parties and people.

This is so sad in everyday life. To hear people I grew up with or I work with say nice things about fascism. To see that in mussolini's hometown people still go to the pilmgrinage.

It's exhausting, to be honest. And the problem is that you can't reason with these people: for them, fascism is like a religion, and they don't believe in anything else than what they learned in their homes growing up.
  6. Yeah sure, let‚Äôs just let fascism rise everywhere in Europe. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen? (Nuclear war)
  7. Goddamn it‚Äôs insidious. Really is everywhere‚Ä¶
  8. Facism ended with a civil war in Italy, and for Germany the exact situation Hitler riled up the people about; government that completely betrayed the people of Germany to fill their own pockets. 

Only a moron would be a facist, but sadly there are a lot of morons out there. All being scammed or grifted by extreme right wingers fuelling their anger with lies. 

Wish we would have some backbone again and punish this dangerous ideology for what it is.
  9. Voglio sbattere la testa contro il muro finch√© non mi sveglio dall‚Äôincubo o perdo ogni capacit√† cognitiva. Non √® un mondo da vivere quello dove nemmeno un secolo dopo la guerra pi√π sanguinosa dell‚Äôintera umanit√† tornano le ideologie del passato gi√† sconfitte al comando. Che depressione che mi viene.
  10. Not a single hairline in sight.
  11. They are just giving their heart to Italy. It's Rome and that's a Roman salute/ s
  12. Nazi groups should be illegal everywhere. 

Its kinda minblowing to see Nazi protests in the US being left alone, while pro Palestine protesters are arrested.
  13. FWIW, here's a 4 year old post showing the exact same thing happening at the same location in 2021:   

https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/n4s0mj/italy_2021_800_fascists_gather_to_perform_a_roman/   

Just to illustrate that this, unfortunately, isn't new.
  14. It's a problem and we know, the majority of Italians hate this situation. We should start doing what Germany is doing, like framing as extremism AfD and starting to act like we really care about our rights and our Constitution since they are in complete contrast with fascist and nazi ideologies. It's time to act now or it'll be bad, again.
  15. every year the same story, a bunch of nostalgics with their arms raised and a group of people who are scandalized, as much as fascist rats disgust me, we Italians have NEVER come to terms with our past. We need to realize that much of our culture has a fascist stamp, even in the little things of everyday life, it is no coincidence that it was invented in Italy. So instead of tearing our teeth out every time we see these fascists, let's answer them on the points. the one in the photo is a commemoration, as incredible as it is, it is not a gathering of politicians who want to restore a fascist dictatorship (maybe only in their mind, they love to be free like us) so configuring it as an apology could be thorny. Personally I think we need to let them do it, the best response I saw was that of a disgusted resident who turned on the song "bella ciao" (absolute chad) while they were doing a minute of silence. two notes of a little song were enough to send them into delirium.

It's a battle that must be fought on a cultural and intimate-family level guys, I bet there are a lot of "racist uncles" of some of you in there. 

what I'm trying to tell you is that we really have to take the leap and come to terms with this stuff, guys this is the time to be cold and cynical like rocks in Antarctica if we want to get rid of this fascist culture once and for all, and as strange as it may sound to you if these exist it is also thanks to an opposition and a left inept and disconnected from reality. Not even the opposition has done anything to stop these groups of nostalgics so let's not be surprised, let's learn to fight these enemies with something that they hate, freedom of thought and expression, and the data and the science. like in school if you hit hard you see that those donkeys will understand, it will take years, decades and we will have to see many of them die of old age before we get rid of them. but that's how it is, for me this is the way. 

I would also like to say one last thing, as much as Italian culture is steeped in fascism there was also an Italy that at the time resisted and fought for years, a culture that created partisans and citizens who loved freedom, precisely, anti-fascists. spoiler they were "few" at the time (enough to beat hard though). and in the second post-war period we still struggle to recognize that essentially we had to pull out a democracy from a country in which the citizens were mostly fascists.
  16. Che schifo, dio caro

  21. World going in funny directions‚Ä¶ everyone hates Jews, being Nazi is more and more normal everyday, tensions and violence everywhere‚Ä¶ good luck everyone
  22. It‚Äôs similar in Sweden. If the protestors (Nazis or not) have permit. They can demonstrate. Anti protestors get more pressure on them since they don‚Äôt have a permit. The demonstration will be shut down if those that registered will not behave.
  24. They tried to ban Fascism after WWII.
That's not how ideologies work. You cannot ban them.
When you actually make people face criminal trial for a "saluto romano" you make right-wingers more radical and neutral people get pissed off.

Battles are fought on the ground, not by evoking a past that almost nobody alive today has truly lived and by applying outdated laws.

The left just doesn't get this. Meloni didn't win because people miss Mussolini, she won because the left sucks and because they are fighting battles that nobody gives a shit about instead of the real ones that we actually want and deserve.
  25. It's the fascist salute (so called "Roman salute") not the Nazi one (the infamous sieg heil) notice how the palm is facing forward.
  26. Someone blasted Bella ciao from an apartment and they threw firecrackers at it
  27. It took 80 years to forget what world war 2 was about...very very sad.
  28. Is balding linked to fascism?
  29. In Italy this is a fascist salute, not a Nazi salute. It may seem like there's no difference but there is. Italian fascism is different to German National Socialism. Even though both are fascist. It should also be noted that the Italians used the salute first and the Germans copied it from them.
  30. Just a reminder: it‚Äôs not just the Nazi salute. The salute actually originated in fascist Italy. Mussolini saw a ‚ÄúRoman Salute‚Äù in a movie and incorporated it into his movement. Before that movie there were no accounts of a Roman salute being like that. So if anyone tries to do the whole argument that says it‚Äôs a Roman salute not a Nazi or fascist salute that‚Äôs absolute bullshit because it was literally just in one movie and then fascist Italy made it their salute. So no, it‚Äôs a fascist salute. Hitler then incorporated it to his fascist regime. So to these Italian fascists they see this in a more nationalistic, original Italian fascism way. Which is of course terrible and corny goofy bullshit. But it‚Äôs not the ‚ÄúNazi salute‚Äù in this context. It‚Äôs the fascist salute that was also used by Nazis. I know it doesn‚Äôt really matter it‚Äôs all the same bullshit I just like history and learned about this last week so I wanted to share.
  31. Wow bunch of losers.
  32. what boredom and lack of self esteem does to a mf
  33. Sometimes it's hard to believe people would be so stupid that they would buy into this BS...
  34. It's so sad seeing Italy following that path.
  35. Disgusting and a disgrace
  36. Why the fuck is this popular? Who's having a better time marching and waving their hand in the air? Has anyone tried chilling the fuck out? Partying? Playing music? Doing something? There's so much more and better things than anger and hate. I will never get it.
  37. Well, Ramelli's story is a sad one. No one should die for a school essay.

So said, the only thing fascists are good for is becoming manure to help plants grow.
  38. I am so fed up with this nazi shyte. Can we get them another planet, please?
  39. How many idiots
  40. In Australia, you‚Äôd go to jail for this.
  41. I swear I can see Elon at the front
  42. Such a shame.

  
I have visited Italy many times. It is a beautiful country and most of the people I met were very pleasant and friendly. 

  
Really sad and disgusted to see this,
  43. They are trying to let you know that their hearts go out to you ...no big deal
  44. Keep it up ragazzi
  45. While just a few days ago on liberation day (april 25th) the police reported a woman who hung an mild antifascist poster outside her bakery.
  46. Not surprised, Italy is one of the most racist places I've been
  47. Obviously the far right is wvil and should be fought at every point, but the far right is NOT in Europe‚Äôs top 10 of problems
  48. Me ne frego.
  49. What disgusts me more is the lack of opposition from neoliberal parties all over the world. Like in the US, they don't see the fascists as a problem.
  50. I don't understand this you're literally making a gesture that tells everyone around you that you want to be controlled and owned by one person and one person only
  51. Reddit just gave me a warning for posting a link of a 1990s video of police officers punching literal Neonazis showing the Hitler salute and saying that I would have liked to see those officers present at this gathering of literal fascists. 

Basically, don‚Äôt imply that you enjoy seeing literal Nazis getting punched by the police, that‚Äôll get you banned. Lol.
  52. Think I see Elon..
  53. Looks more the Alopecia Solidarity Pride.
  54. As an Italian, I'm deeply ashamed.
  55. I'm starting to ask myself frequently if it's worth taking the next step and having a kid with how the world is going
  56. Recently on an Italian subreddit a few policemen did an AMA, many people asked why are they not doing anything against the fascist meetings.

The answers were on the line of: we don‚Äôt have enough policemen, it takes on average 4 policemen for each protestant, this means there are 8 less eyes in dangerous areas to prevent murders and other heavy stuff, while these people will just go, raise their arms, yell a bit and then go back home. 

On one side I know that also in my southern Italian city the people working in police (carabinieri etc.) are very few, like 4 for an entire province, so this discourse may make sense.

On the other side I think if you don‚Äôt have enough policemen to arrest the fascists then you need to call the army and have the army take them to prison; this was also proposed but the answers are ‚Äúthis will give them purpose, increase their number and make them more violent‚Äù.

Personally I think if you want to follow the same path as Mussolini then society should immediately make you meet the same end he had; on one side I understand that violence only generates more violence, on the other side the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) cannot be ignored.
  57. I‚Äôm so sick of everything backsliding almost everywhere in Europe. I live in Spain and I wish I could be optimistic about the future but I‚Äôm not. I don‚Äôt think Italy or my country will have a democracy in the next ten years.
  58. This is the result of ostracizing one side and telling that they are extremists, they actually became extremists because the left kept calling them extremists‚Ä¶
  59. Look Americans, there's are Nazi. Open your eyes now.
  60. Just fucking arrest them all.  Pass a law and crack down.  We can't keep watching them grow and do nothing.  We can't let down all those who sacrificed to save this world.
  61. Fascism just making a comeback like this everywhere in the West? Damn we really going to go through with this shit again....for the love of god the Fascists will drag everyone in the globe down again unless we kick them out.
  62. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  63. Why is everyone surprised? Italy is run by fascists. And fascists, strangely enough, behave like fascists. This is what you get when you have a highly uneducated population in financial crisis.
  64. Oh! It‚Äôs the unfuckable men‚Äôs club.
  65. I hear and read people saying that these demonstrations have always existed, and that‚Äôs exactly the problem. The successive governments, for reasons of votes and out of sheer impudence, have always pretended not to see them. It‚Äôs only natural that in today‚Äôs historical moment these demonstrations are becoming more concerning, especially when we have a government in which the Speaker of the House proudly displays a bust of Mussolini at home and brags about it publicly, or the Prime Minister who, in several past videos, said Mussolini was a great man and even founded a party based on that belief.

The real issue is that we are crushed daily by abuses from our own neighbors. We have starvation wages, a tax burden that doesn‚Äôt match the level of services and infrastructure we receive, unstable jobs, undeclared work, underpaid jobs‚Äîor all of the above. The average Italian thinks about how to scam the state by getting benefits they don‚Äôt actually need. There‚Äôs no oversight of many entrepreneurs who declare nothing to the tax authorities, and there‚Äôs no serious fight against corruption, illegal construction, and tax evasion at any level.

Among all this, there are also fascists who hope that by bringing fascism back to Italy, things will get better‚Äîwhen in fact it was one of, if not *the* most disastrous chapter in Italian history. But as many say‚Äîand they‚Äôre right‚Äîfascism seems more like a religion than a political movement.

Finally, most people in Italy don‚Äôt give a damn about which political party is in power, as long as corruption, illegal construction, and tax evasion continue‚Äîthe things they love so much. A few people, especially young ones, are fed up with this situation, but we‚Äôre a minority, as shown by the huge number of young people leaving Italy every year. And who can blame them...

As a recommendation, I suggest watching the series *Mussolini*, which gives a good overview of just how grotesque, violent, and ridiculous Mussolini and his party truly were.
  66. I've not had this sub come up for a while, so it's nice to know you guys are no longer pro facist
  67. He was not a fascist,he only had right wing ideas and wrote in a school assignment that he didn't like the radical left party of that time. He was then killed for that.
Also left wing activists are being identified because they are attacking police officers without cause
  69. this is only propaganda, the police had only done their duty in both cases, the fascists had the permits for their demonstration, the antifascists had not requested permits for their demonstrations, so the police were monitoring them.
  70. If they are escorted by police then they are there as participants of a registered demonstration, while the communists are there to disrupt the demonstration. Henche the fascists are protected and the people they need to be protected against are registered.  

It will never be funni how people lamenting fascism are up in arms when the state is not acting according to the involved parties political affiliation.
  71. Yeah Italy is fucked
  72. Like it or not, it is nothing new. It always happened irrespectively of the colour of the country government and city administration. A quick search on youtube gives videos from past "editions": 10 years ago: [https://youtu.be/sNbae2g0FmU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/sNbae2g0FmU?feature=shared) 6 years ago [https://youtu.be/bCVI36Ln6Cg?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/bCVI36Ln6Cg?feature=shared)
  73. Sad when literal nazi are more peaceful that your group
  74. Historical fact: Mussolini made this salute in 1922, during the March on Rome. At that time he was "only" a fascist, since n\*zism didn't exist yet. That the symbolism was later swallowed up by n\*zism all over the world is certain.  Now, in Italy, I could see that it "only" expressed fascism. Fascism and n\*zism are very different, for example:

1. Race: Nazism focuses on Aryan superiority, fascism ignores race.
2. Anti-Semitism: Nazism is inherently anti-Semitic, while Italian Fascism was not originally anti-Semitic.
3. Nationalism: Nazism advocated racial pangermanism, while Fascism exalted the Italian nation-state.
4. Economy: Corporatist state fascism; Nazism mixes capitalism with racialized state control.
5. Culture: Nazism's obsession with racial purity; Fascism's glorification of imperial and Roman grandeur.
  75. They must be Tired of Muslims invading their country lol
  76. Prison 10> years, now.
  77. Police work is attractive to people like that. A license to abuse your power over a helpless civilian? Fascists and Nazis both love that shit, so they tend to fill police ranks.

And when a fascist rises to power, he already has allies.
  78. Don't tell us to Google search some shit in the title. You got time for a post? You got time for a link.
  79. I see many people trying to teach conclusion or finding causes. Please keep in mind that as disgusting as it is this fascist gatherings with fascist salute happens in italy since many years. At least since the 2010s and possibly even before. Just to give a bit of context.
  80. The situation in Italy regarding fascism is bad.

Naples its the only place where i got actually scared because of the huge anmount of fascist graffitis...

Sad to see such a beautifull country falling to fear and hate speach...
  81. **Bella Ciao intesifies in the background**
  82. But if we say Meloni's Government is fascist we get downvoted because "We are woke idiots that think everyone different from them is fascist".

Idc if you are an Italian moderate right-winger, even if you voted Forza Italia you contributed to this shit, therefore fuck you.

An even bigger fuck you to the huge percentage of the population who did not vote. Of these people, Dante thought they were so vile they weren't even worthy of Hell.
  83. Disgusting behavior, but calling Ramelli (a 18 years old boy that got bullied for criticizing a Red Brigades terrorist attack and then was killed by said bullies with wrenches) a fascist is a stretch.
  84. Based on this image there might be a direct correlation between nazism and baldness‚Ä¶
  85. Let me tell you about my grandfather and how he died. He wasn't a bad man. He wasn't a great man. He was the average man. He was healthy when i was young. He took me on bicycle rides to the park. He always laughed and never screamed. He kept the family together. 

One day, he stepped on a rusty nail. He didn't think much of it. He never told anyone. Until the pain came. Every step he took, it was agony. He went to the hospital reluctantly. (We weren't poor, but we weren't rich either. He was worried about the costs.) The doctor told him his foot was infected, his toes were black, he could either cut his toes off, but the infection could come back, or his foot, as it was much safer. My grandfather, the chose the more conservative option and removed only some of the toes. 

He was never the same after. He didn't smile like he used to, even if he tried.

The infection came back. It took his whole leg this time. He didn't smile anymore. He was sour, he hated everything but me, I looked the most like him. My cousins were treated badly. They didn't look like him, not really. He became abusive and violent, even if he couldn't put his mouth where his words were.

He lost the ability to walk altogether. He needed a wheelchair, and he would cough all the time. Then he died. I didn't feel bad. Because he was bad. Not my family, though. They cried because they saw him as human, but all I saw was a shell of a human being. He died somewhere in-between, I can't really point where, but I know it was when he started treating his own family as shit.

TLDR: Fascists are an infection. It must be cut out and treated entirely, not left to fester. Once they stop treating others as humans, that is the day they lose all rights to be called human.
  86. Tear the fascists down down down
  87. Help us get rid of them again
  88. Italy has a problem with fascists but no one will admit it
  89. Funny how fascists worldwide claim a liberal ‚Äúnew world order‚Äù is to be feared while transparently they‚Äôre creating one of their own
  90. We are making history again...in the wrong side...again ... mamma mia! ü§å
  91. You don't have to go full Nazi because you are balding or bald ..there are other options
  92. This is terrible. And pro-russian Telegram channels in my country are using this as proof that Europe is promoting fascism now. The EU leaders have to make a stance against things like this. Cause if they don't.......then we are all f*cked!
  93. American here, just wanna say there were so many idiot Nazi apologists who said Musk‚Äôs salute couldn‚Äôt be a Nazi salute because he didn‚Äôt do every exact little thing that ‚Äúmakes it‚Äù specifically a Nazi salute. Clicking his heels and shit.

This right here proves that shit doesn‚Äôt need to be present. These people are in a group, and a bunch aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdoing it correctly.‚Äù Anyone that does this sort of thing and has the values of Nazis, is a fucking Nazi.
  94. And people wonder why I advocate for more places to adopt the German policy on that """roman salute""".
  95. they have a former MSI in charge. What did you expect?
  96. Italian here: it's true, the government supports and doesn't do shit about these fascists, meanwhile if someone from the left is identified as anti-fascist, police will come and ask for ids and maybe for a fantastic tour to their "caserma" (barrack) to have a chat.

On April the 25th a baker set up a banner with anti-fascist slogan (nothing violent) and the carabinieri showed up, took the baker's ids and took off the banner.

These are facts, not opinions.
  97. I'd wager if Ramelli was alive today, these same people would bully him because "he has long hair and looks like a girl"
  98. It's an annual event, [here's the article from 2021](https://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2021/04/29/news/neofascismo_sergio_ramelli_saluto_romano_centinaia_persone_presidio-298697230/) *(I wanted to link archive ph but apparently that's not allowed...)*
  99. Why is Italy so full of extremists? Just a few days ago, on a thread in this same subreddit, there were tens of people vehemently defending the picture of someone flying the Soviet flag (taken in Italy), with all sorts of mental gymnastics for why that's ok, and now this?
  100. I am so tired with this fucking country.
  101. Italy is healing
  102. Didn‚Äôt Italy elect a Fascist?
  104. its mad that the fact that our grandparents beat the nazi's so we can live in a free world and that has let the nazi's become now  more protected legally...Now for some reason these people have more human rights than i do now even in the the UK

  109. I saw a shop in Italy with bottles of Hitler wine in the window. Weird.
  110. Why are these guys so hellbent on having the Nazis make a comeback or turning the clock back to the 19th century?
  111. Okay so I have no real insight into this. But I will say as a New Zealander, that I really feel like it‚Äôs good for us that we are a young country, with total awareness that we‚Äôre not really the best at anything.  
Self awareness on a global level.  
So patriotism feels kinda weird. I mean sure there is plenty my country does that I‚Äôm proud of, but not in the same way.  
I feel like with a country like Italy, it‚Äôs not all that surprising that someone like Mussolini would come around, and it‚Äôs not that surprising that these attitudes would stick around. Because *everyone* knows about the Roman Empire. A lot of people know that Britain was first colonized by Rome, that half of Europe was part of Rome. That Rome was one of the most dominant empires in history. Roman architecture is still all over Europe and Latin Languages would be the most spoken languages in the world, considering a huge percentage of English is based in Latin too.  
Make Italy great again works on many levels, and at the moment they are not doing as well as they were in the past.
  112. Doesn't look anything like the Musk wave. ü§£
  113. Crazy. I can literally see that church from my school where I work.
  114. Looking at the number of bald spots... I mean, I know first hand that growing bald is a frustrating process but there is no need to deviate to far right or start worshipping Jim morrison wannabes with flowing long hair (though I must admit, it makes me a bit envious too).
  115. Lotsa bald men in the pic, their genetics can‚Äôt be all that great. Fascists are completely self aware.

  133. The Italians invented fascism so they are pretty good at it. I prefer their food more than their totalitarian ideologies tho. They also make nice cars, shoes and suits.

Can someone from Italy explain this to me? It made very little sense to us. It basically ruined our honeymoon. It seemed like we were specifically being targeted because we are an interracial couple (I‚Äôm white, my wife is not) and I think that because of multiple incidences where people immediately pulled a 180 in their attitude with me when they realized that we were together.¬†
  182. We already know what to do with them. We've done it before we will do it again.

  1. "...And by the way if you hadn't wanted to install a burglar alarm in the first place, the burglar wouldn't have had to break into your home in the first place. You started this"
  2. Come on, everybody knows Zelenskyy, he doesn't really need a name on his shirt.

Now, who is the buffoon on the left?
  3. I hope Zelensky won't accept such stupidity, Trump doesn't deserve any win in these talks.
  4. \* and I get your TV for helping you make this deal
  5. Zelensky is somehow the bad guy for not signing this 'peace deal'?.

Ukraine gain absolutely nothing, and they are signing their own death warrant. It just sets them up for the next invasion.
  6. Trump can relate to the criminal.....34 times
  7. So pretty much the same as the Ireland/UK peace plan..
  8. Eastern Europe after WW2
  9. Oh, and you have to dig up your yard and give me half of what you find
  10. "...and in return you get to not keep any guns or sharp objects in your house forever."
  11. Palestinians watching this thinking at least you have access to your own front door still.........
  12. I thought of this analogy too, it's an effective one.
  13. Why does every political cartoon share the same ugly style?
  14. Same deal being given to the Palestinians since 48 lmao
  15. Don‚Äôt forget giving up your nukes to Russia for
Promise of no invasion 20 years earlier‚Ä¶.
  16. I hate how europe is too weak to single handedly help Ukraine in millitary aid.
  17. That‚Äôs the exact same deal he wants Palestine to accept from Israel.
  18. "and don't forget to say thank-you"
  19. Crimea is a strategic deep water Port. It's an essential military position and I don't see Russia signing any piece Accord without keeping it. They really don't have to either. Putin will sacrifice generations without blinking to keep it.
  20. Sounds very smart little donny.      Now run back to the golf course.
  21. How is Ukraine going to get the territory back? Honest question? I know I‚Äôll get downvoted for asking a question that doesn‚Äôt fit the lefts narrative of pushing propaganda.
  22. I mean, what's the alternative? Is the great European army going to push Russia out? Trump is in reality, and he sees that Russia isn't throwing anywhere near their complete strength at Ukraine, and they're slowly gaining ground. They have been for months. It's not like NATO is going to go to war with Russia over this, so that means Ukraine must make concessions.
  23. Palestinians looking at the irony, but since they attackers are Jewish we must not say anything. 
Don‚Äôt forget:
Israeli jews stole nuclear secrets from the U.S.
Israeli jews attacked the USS Liberty and killed Americans
Israeli jews are responsible for the Lavon affair
Israeli jews were seen ‚Äúdocumenting‚Äù 9/11
Israeli jews convinced Americans that we needed to destabilize the countries around Israel 
Israeli dual citizens buy our policians and have ties to Jeffrey Epstein 
Israeli jews used Oct 7 as an excuse to conduct genocide
  24. Feel free to reject the deal, it's not America's war.
  25. Odd coming from the people against self-defense.
  26. The alternative is world war 3. Not my kid‚Äôs fight.
  27. The lack of self awareness in this us mind boggling.
  28. Oh and same for Israel.
  29. Not on your Nellie!!!!  Trump is INSANE!!! He is America's WORST enemy.
  30. Okay here's what Europe should do: 

Sit and watch their neighbor get invaded while crying about the guy in a different hemisphere not helping enough.
  31. The whataboutism in this thread is insane.
  32. So it's okay when the Palestinians have to accept th same for the last 40 years?
  33. Sounds like Isra√´l
  34. Why don't Europe go in and make a deal? Or better yet send troops? Why ask US for anything?
  35. Mean while everyone else just standing by watching the guy break in saying I wish we could help but we scared he nuke us..I don't like trump but don't pretend anyone is better
  36. Russia took over Crimea in 2014. I haven't seen a European countries, or a coalition of them, make any meaningful effort to get them to leave. I did however see countries shutting down power generation, especially Germany, so they had to buy Nat Gas from Russia. Do you think this money perhaps enabled them to invade Ukraine? And made you weaker and unable to do anything about it? 

The US now has to broker a peace deal with a crap set of circumstances the current US administration had zero hand in creating. That is entirely Biden and his/his administration's incompetence combined with a feckless EU. 

Europe has been able to accomplish squat since the invasion in February 2022, THREE years ago. But yeah, insult and undermine what has a chance to work because Trump/the US is leading it. As you haven't figured it out, leading from the back does not work. And if you think you aren't trying to, what is your peace plan to resolve the situation? Are YOU going to war in Ukraine to expel Russia? Obviously not, you've had three years to do it and haven't even loaded one round into a magazine.
  37. Democrats and European leaders unironically say this word for word to the Palestinians. The self-awareness is zero.
  38. Exactly what the world told Palestinians to do
  39. Who is the bloke on the left?
  40. I love the hands, nice touch
  41. Love the juice box
  42. It‚Äôs ironic how Trump is ‚Äúsecure the border, ohh god, the border‚Äù but when Ukraine does the same he hates it. Obviously it‚Äôs because not his country not his problem, but I do wish we had a president who advocated for self-determination (and followed through).
  43. I think it goes to show the level of his arrogance that nobody else has really tried to broker peace, but he's so confident that he's going to, and it's predictably falling flat
  44. dont forget the stolen children
  45. Pretty much. 

Also, how DARE Zelenskyy not literally break the Ukrainian constitution and allow Russia to brutally seize what it swore by treaty it would not?!
  46. Who‚Äôs this cartoonist? I‚Äôd love to see some of his Biden stuff.
  47. Or idk kick him out and stop depending on American for literally everything
  48. And I will take all the valuables you have in your home, why ain't you happy?
  49. Kitchen, Guest Bedroom, and Den? Is this a blue prince reference?
  50. And for facilitating this deal trump will get half of the household income.
  51. Oh wait, i've seen this one. I wonder where!
  52. Or he can continue and take your entire house, and wipe everyone in it off the face of the planet.
  53. You forgot to mention the alternative, which might be letting your house burn down and killing everyone inside.

There's something about leftist ethos that doesn't allow for dealing with difficult situations where tough choices are necessary for overall good at the expense of immediate justice. 

The left is so obsessed with its idea of justice that it forgets that the world just doesn't work that way. It would be great if it did. But we have to deal with the world the way it is, not the way we wish it were.
  54. Yeah Ukraine is now Europe's Palestine.
Sooner there'll be "two state solution" rhetoric of which Ukrainians are forced to settle for, while Russia annexes the whole Ukraine inch by inch. 
And any form of Ukrainian resistance will be branded terrorism.
  55. You know, the zio way
  56. yeah, yeah, but what about 2014?
  57. "HERES THE DEAL, LET THE GUY WHO BROKE IN AND ATTACKED YOUR FAMILY, REMAIN INSIDE AND BE GIFTED THE KITCHEN, GUEST BEDROOM AND DEN..."

"THEN YOU GIVE ME ALL THE MONEY, JEWELLERY AND FURNITURE IN YOUR HOUSE FOR BROKERING THE DEAL, OK?"
  58. Sounds a lot like another country‚Ä¶
  59. The plan of a wilted, saggy shrunken carrot.
  60. Fabulous deal. Best deal ever!
  61. I appreciate the juice box. That's speaking through art. ü§å
  62. Sounds exactly like the Democrats plan for the illegal immigrants who broke in, attacked the citizens, etc etc etc
  63. Ukraine was a part of Russia anyway.
  64. Go fight your war then Europe.   Easy to talk big when the us does your dirty work.
  65. And they won't start again the very next day because why exactly?
  66. That is basically the peace deal offered by Obama in 2014.
  67. and in exchange the guy who broke in promises (pinky promise!) not to take the whole house from you and kick you out!
  68. Is it true that Ukraine is not drafting anyone into the military who is under 27 years of age?
  69. *Th Piss Plan
  70. And don‚Äôt forget to thank him
  71. ‚ÄúThe art of the deal‚Äù
  72. Guy who burgled your house: "I want more".
  73. Oh and imma need my fee.
  74. Post this in r/israel :)))
  75. Its funny how r/europe understands this scenario when it comes to Russia and Ukraine, but can't seem to grasp it when it's Israel/Palestine.
  76. Cool now do palestine
  77. Anyone want to explain why it it our responsibility to fund Ukraine?
  78. Reminds me of another conflict
  79. Ok but realistically what is the alternative? In what world does Russia not get at least Crimea and the Donbas out of this war?
  80. I genuinely want to know what is the reasonable end to the war? We all know that Putin is not letting go of the territories in Ukraine any time soon.
  81. Okay then, what is your peace plan? Can you please tell me what it is exactly that Europe is wanting to do?
  82. Nobody who likes this comic has an alternative except for infinity more people dying with no end.

There is no situation in which Ukraine retakes the conquered territory.  It's a fantasy.
  83. Obama did nothing when Putin took Crimea.
  84. I mean let‚Äôs be honest here, Ukraine isn‚Äôt taking back their lost territory, especially Crimea without a serious escalation by the west. No western country wants to do that.
  85. Israel and palestine?

like if putin says that ukraine has his promised oil 5000 years ago, would you justify it?
  86. The crazy part is, all the anti Trumpers are saying the EXACT SAME THING about the illegal aliens. Let the illegal aliens that broke in keep getting welfare, food stamps, housing subsidies, free education and free health care!  

How they are unable to see the hypocrisy is mind-boggling.
  87. Don‚Äôt sign the deal if you don‚Äôt like it, and then figure it out for yourself.
  88. if euro nations want to go boots on the ground they are more than welcome to, but its not americas job to put out every fire europe starts.
  89. Trump is a known russian asset. Of course his "plan" is to give putin everything the kremlin wants.
  90. ok  asking genuine question  what is the alternative  here  seriously please someone outline me a better  idea for this war
  91. Trump Netanyahu Orban Milei Le Pen Meloni
  92. Lol from the country that has been saved by the US countless times
  93. Oh so now all the sudden ppl want trump to kick ppl out of a country they entered illegally.
  94. Sounds like how democrats talk about illegal immigrants
  95. Plus, give us your garage that way if the guy who breaks in attacks you again, we‚Äôll somehow have more incentive to help. In exchange you get a pack of cards.
  96. Trump is a failure and Little Dobby Putin is a failure too!  Trump can't save Ukraine without supporting them, but his Puppet master Dobby  Putin wont allow it!
  97. ...and custody of the children.




Won't somebody think of the children!
  98. This is the same deal Trump gave the States and they loved it. 

Hell, they made the family attack department above due process and everyone did a big walk about it
  99. Donne is a Russian asset and nobody will ever forget it:
  100. I recently learnt that there was much wider support for Nazi germany during ww2 than i thought. If not for pearl Harbour and then president pushing back against nazism sympathy on all cylinders, I dread to think.
  101. ... and then say "thank you"!
  102. Zelensky told him he has the same blackmail that Poetin has on him.
  103. His face looks like a russian warship, I'd told him to go fuck himself
  104. A most suspicious peace treaty. Besides being blatantly one sided, Ukraine isn't at the level where it's an unconditional surrender, and Russia isn't at the level where it's no longer feasible to attack or lacks popular support. Can it be called a peace treaty when there is nothing enforcing the idea of peace?

Not sure if I'm understanding correctly but without real motivations for upholding peace, anyone is free to break it and resume bombing the next day or month. Also nothing is stopping this into turning into some sort of IRA movement later on.
  105. As an American, Z-man and EU should tell the orange to eat a far dick.
  106. Trump is a scumbag.
  107. All that's missing are the Big Mac's and fries shoved in his pie whole@
  108. Funny Games
  109. Best offer ever /s
  110. The juice box should be a diet coke bottle
  111. Build a world in which Trump is not relevant.

In that world, he cannot hurt, betray, or disappoint anyone.
  112. Wtf is a guest bedroom? Wtf is a den? I'm too poor for this.
  113. Almost thought Tarantinos Red Apple cigarettes made an appearance
  114. This deal sounds familiar
  115. Wow, this cartoon makes Trump sound like a democrat and zelensky like a homeowner with a squatter.
  116. Yea "murican' fuker terorist one of bigest ever was in the world
  117. Trump bad! M‚Äôkay?
  118. I've used this analogy many times.
  119. Sounds like UK immigration policy.
  120. He better say thank you too
  121. That sounds like what California is going to pass into law in the near future.
  122. Zelensky: Get fucked.

Trump: Why is the left so unreasonable?
  123. The art of the deal!
  124. Notice how people who do not have to fight the war are so quick to advocate that people on all sides keep dying in holes in the ground.

Funny that.
  125. The United States engaged in a similar course of action with Bosnia when the nation was on the verge of regaining its sovereignty. However the main difference between Ukraine and Bosnia is that the United States threatened to initiate aerial bombardment of Bosnia. It is my hope that Ukraine will be able to regain as much territory as possible. However, I am skeptical that they will be able to retake the all of the territory they have lost to the Russians.
  126. Now do one with Chuck Schumer talking to trump about illegal immigration
  127. Thx for clarifying that‚Äôs zelenskyy
  128. Yep. Well it‚Äôs Either that or fight him. You know what‚Ä¶ go ahead and fight him.
  129. Isn‚Äôt that the deal that the left wants to offer the US over the illegals that have ‚Äúbroken in?‚Äù
  130. It‚Äôs sad they let one of Putin lackeys set the terms for a cease-fire. It nothing but pathetic. I hope the rest of the world will aid Ukraine since America has failed its ally or probably our biggest threat in American history. Soon Putin will be in claim de parts of America
  131. Truth
  132. I guess the US could get directly involved. Foreign wars are fun after all.
  133. "And then give me half your belongings, forever"
  134. So are you all against countries being invaded or not? I can't tell with all the contradictions
  135. If Trump escalated the war, they'd just talk about how the world is ending because we're entering World War 3... crazy thing is, we already kind of are in WW3 thanks to Biden's direct actions within NATO.
  136. That juice box is a vibe üßÉ
  137. This sounds like what we're being told to do with our illegal immigrants.
  138. ...and did you thank me for being here?
  139. Yeah, that's what losing a war is like
  140. Looks like a good argument against immigration
  141. How exactly are the Russians going to be removed from the occupied territories?
  142. The alternate is the guy who broke in kills the rest of his family. 

You tell me which is a worse outcome.
  143. As much as it all sucks‚Ä¶ what can anybody do about it?
  144. Political cartoons in 2025üíî
  145. Or keep fighting and lose all of it. That does not feel like a winnable war.
  146. Just give me my tax money back
  147. Y'all seem really obsessed with making the US fund war üíÄ
  148. Is Putin disses trump which seems to be the case , trump is basically done as a ‚Äúdeal maker‚Äù or anything else really, Putin bows down to no one and will continue his advancement into Ukraine and there is nothing his bestest buddy can do about it
  149. Well the guy has nuclear weapons so...
  150. Trump is totally corrupted. He's Putin's shill and he's NOT going to to anything for Ukraine.
  151. I mean how does he plan on getting it back. Getting another million people killed. Is that worth land
  152. They are fighting a war. What is supposed to happen when one side loses? Like wtf.
  153. Yikes, heard that one 75 years ago.
  154. I understand the perspective, but what is the alternative?

This is a serious question and I'd love to hear your replies.  I think it's fair to assume that other nations do not want to put "boots on the ground" and risk a direct military confrontation with Russia.

There's a lot of finger pointing going on, but I'm far more interested in reasonable, actionable solutions.
  155. Lies
  156. I don¬¥t like it either but Trump or not-Trump there isn¬¥t any chance for Ukraine to win for some quite time yet.

When your only realistical options are (a) keep a half of your house (for now) and (b) your family dies and you lose everything, then you are probably going to keep the half of house.
  157. And what about the Zionist israel ?
  158. Hard to be a shittier American than a Trump supporter these days
  159. Ukraine isn't winning they need to take a deal. And yes Russia will likely invade again next time America shows global weakness.
  160. Now we know how Americans feel when the left screams about illegals rights in our country. HMMM.
  161. Why the apple-drink?
  162. I approve of this plan.

-- Vlad Pootin
  163. Oh I can already tell him what we've crucified my Reddit. For this zelensky should count himself lucky. He's even got .What he got out of peace deal after the complete disrespect, he showed for our country and our leaders. When he walked into the white house, not even bothering to dress, appropriately and demanding weapons and money like a child.I think trump should have completely left him to his own devices. And before anybody tries to ask if I have no empathy, I have empathy for americans and american problems.I'm sorry you're suffering over there across the pond.But there ain't jack s***, I can do about it.My country's more important for me
  164. A year ago I was speaking to an older, well-educated British guy. We were talking about why the Brits are afraid of Russia and nuclear war? They're pretty far away.

We're in Poland, next door to Ukraine and Russia, and we don't really fear Russia or their nukes. Would we have a huge problem if they tried to invade? We sure would, but it's not a reason to not help Ukraine kick their ass.

Why is the rest of the world afraid? This hardly affects them.
  165. Oh ok just keep losing territory daily then!
  166. I mean I'm not too well researched on the topic, but wouldn't this be better than the continued bloodshed? Eventually there will be no Ukraine because of all of the casualties. Not saying I agree with the plan, but anything is better then more pointless casualties.
  167. At least i can fortify in the toiletüò≠
  168. Sounds like a bad SNL skit!!
  169. I am not a trump guy. I do think my 401k was way better off when he was in 6 last time. This time I'm not sure what he thinks he is doing. 
I like that he is chasing jobs out of China ( that's good). He is not bringing them to the US. He is sending them to other places. He has not offered to help bring manufacturing back to the US. He is just moving it around the globe. 
 Where is our cheap gas??
 Where are our low interest rates????
All he has done is stop the building of windmills. And renamed some stuff that didn't need a new name.
 This is the exact same thing Biden did. Changing base names and killing our cheap oil pipeline.  How is trump different?
  170. Trump is pure evil! ¬†He is fucking up our Country, our world relationship, our economy! ¬†Fuck everyone who voted him in!!!
  171. Isn‚Äôt it exactly about Israel?))
  172. You all want to send in ground troops to kick out Russia, be my guest.
  173. Why can't Z just help us out, Russians and their related nations are known for taking care of things, it only takes a handshake
  174. W for Russia
  175. I‚Äôm not willing to risk nuclear war over Ukraine and the only way to push Russia out is to deploy NATO troops.
  176. *‚ÄúLet the guy who broke in and attacked your family, remain inside and be gifted the kitchen, guest bedroom, and den‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Trump‚Äôs Ukraine strategy sounds an awful lot like Biden‚Äôs immigration strategy.
  177. Or since he‚Äôs bigger and stronger than you you can fight him and lose it all. How about that? Because it‚Äôs not our job to help you but we don‚Äôt care what you do but if you want to not die and have your whole country lost you might want to agree to this.
  178. Now this I agree with. 

But if Biden had any balls. He would have stopped Putin in his tracks. The US is wrong for letting this happen.
  179. Europe should take over, but they aren't competent enough
  180. Or, we can trade nukes!
  181. Am I misunderstanding something? Isn‚Äôt there more to it than this analogy?
  182. I know it sounds bad but they dont have any other things russia wants and I'd rather not go to war
  183. Zelensky isn‚Äôt going to get Crimea back and that is on Obama 2014 !  There needs to be peace !
  184. You're right we should totally get Germany to invade russia again.
  185. Europe needs to step up to the plate, the USA is tired of carrying your pansy asses. It‚Äôs in your back yard.
  186. The plan was peace, he wants war, i say let him doom his country, the fool doesn't even respect the help given saying bs like they are doing this all on their own
  187. Hears the deal you democrats can go fight a losing war with a nuclear power for your beloved Ukraine and keep the rest of us out!!!
  188. And give us most of the valuable minerals from your country
  189. I think this political cartoon needs more labels. /s
  190. It's more of a crack/meth house than a home but still accurate
  191. We can argue about fairness for another three years. Show me the plan that forces Putin to surrender.
  192. Backslash indicates a young illiterate cartoonist
  193. So when it comes to other countries liberals are against invaders, but not this country. Got it y'all make so much sense now.
  194. Ukraine isn't a single entity. Don't forget.
  195. Just swop out the juice box for a diet coke and this is bang on.
  196. And give us half your bank account.
  197. Cool, how about that whole making opposition parties illegal, cancelling elections, and seizing all media for the state?
  198. Wonder if any of you even know the right story or if you are left wing brained lol. Ukraine started the bullshit he literally murdered his own civilians by pushing Russia and breaking treaty.. zelenske is a pos murderer and deserves nothing from the U.S.. he's lucky he gets any help.
  199. Demonstrates no understanding of the conflict
  200. The US has provided 66.5 billion to Ukraine, yet Europeans are astonished the US doesn't have free health care.

=== POST #19 ===
**Title:** Robert Francis Prevost Mart√≠nez was choosen as the new pope
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 33278
**Comments (67):**
  1. he looks popey enough
  2. It's funny that the guy to succeed Pope Francis is actually named Francis
  3. First tweet on his personal Twitter account is a retweet criticising Trump and Bukele
  4. Stolen, Seagull was the true winner.
  5. An American surprisingly
  6. He was elevated to cardinal by Francis and is anti-Trump; this is a stance on the part of the Vatican
  7. I would have never bet on a american Pope ! He's the first
  8. An American, but not one of the frontrunners, right? He's not the conservative nutjob everyone feared, BBC characterized him as a moderate, similar to Francis.
  9. We missed out on Pope Pizzaballa, and I will mourn this forever.
  10. He has disagreed with Trump and Vance on twitter. JD Vance is going to kill a second pope
  11. Pope Sea-Gull I. is very disappointed.
  12. We now have younger Pope than a Trump
  13. I've not read much about him, is this a good thing overall?
  14. Jesus Christ, stop the fearmongering.

It's not a conservative, but rather a centrist (like Francis), because otherwise there would be no majority to choose them.
  15. We will never hear the end of it.
  16. Against Trumpüëç
  17. Its rigged it shouldve been me
  18. Pope Bob
  19. For everyone expecting to see an ultra-conservative, he's not.

[His Twitter ](https://x.com/drprevost)is full of tweets saying things like "JD Vance is wrong", praising vaccines, honoring George Floyd and most recently criticising Trump for using the Oval office to laugh at the deportation of that US citizen to Salvador.

This was 100% a political move and taking a stance against the current US administration.
  20. Papa Americano üé∂
  21. So the cardinals, primarily part of the boomer generation and solely consisting of men, have chosen a younger and more progressive leader than the population of the USA. Got it.
  22. In RTP (Portugal) they say he is progressive
  23. He's from Chicago. Wonder if his views on pizza will be controversial. New Yorkers for example don't consider Chicago-style pizza as legitimate pizza. I can only imagine what the Italians would think....
  24. He has an bachelor of Math!  
  
So he doesn't just understand sin. He also understands cos ! And also he knows how to tan.

and he can add, substract und devide but he isn't allowed to multiply!
  25. #justice4Pizzaballa
  26. Welcome Pope Bob!
  27. I hope he continues the legacy of Pope Francis on criticizing the US government and their treatment of immigrants and marginalized communities.
  28. As an American: holy fucking shit! What‚Äôs better is he‚Äôs been characterized as a ‚Äúlistener‚Äù like Francis. So I‚Äôm very hopeful he‚Äôs going to be a progressive pope too.
  29. I feared a conservative backlash. This could be a good pope.
  30. Smart move by the Vatican choosing an American pope to avoid tariffs.
  31. Of course he's american.

My dreams of a Pope Pizza (balla) are over :(
  32. Do not investigate about "Case Prevost USA - Peru".
  33. Trump and MAGA are absolutely going to treat this is their doing and take it as further vindication of their ‚Äúgreatness‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  34. Damn America colonlized the Vatican.
  36. I beg he continues Pope Francis' agenda. Being more accepting instead of inciting hate like so many religious people do these days.
  37. Pope needs to call down some of that Vatican magic. Rid us of the Trump regime.
  38. Next move: excommunicate JD.....
  39. Not my pope! I wanted the seagul!
  40. Will Trump deport the Pope, if he visits?
  41. I'm not disappointed this time either.
  42. Love reading the wiki article about him and seeing that he gave a job (near a school!) to a guy who almost certainly sexually abused minors. 

Fuck's sake, catholic church.
  43. Ok but how much is the tariff on popes
  44. They wanted a bulwark against the rising tide.
  45. They say he has the heart of a missionary and aligns with Pope Francis though he is less outspoken and weighs his words.  
I'm sure the orange jackass will have a stupid comment. He always does.
  46. Please be good
  47. Not religious by any count, but everyone knows the power of the Catholic church, so this is good (saying that as someone who side eyes them often; they do do good also). Good luck to him, and maybe time to reintroduce food tasters because some people will not be happy.
  48. All hail Pope Bob üôå
  49. Prevost is an Augustinian: a member of the Order of Saint Augustine, founded on his teaching, and known for its communal life, scholarship, and mix of faith and reason. He spent years in Peru as a seminary rector and bishop, overseeing priestly formation at the Major Seminary of Chiclayo, building formation groups and job programs among indigenous and urban communities. He then ran the Dicastery for Bishops in Rome. That is the Vatican office responsible for vetting episcopal candidates, managing leadership transitions, and shaping the global face of the Church. He was made a cardinal in 2023: elevated by Francis in recognition of his blend of pastoral sensitivity and leadership savvy, granting him a key voice in guiding the church.

With this being such a quick vote it likely points to a consensus pick for a steady, admin-like pope who‚Äôll likely keep Francis‚Äô pastoral focus but bring more structure. This suggests the cardinals rallied around someone who combines Francis' emphases, approachability, and political savvy with clear governance.

Choosing ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù probably nods to Leo the Great‚Äôs doctrinal emphasis (defined Chalcedonian Christology, defended the two natures of Christ, and reinforced papal primacy) and maybe Leo XIII‚Äôs social teaching (modern catholic social teaching emphasizing the rights of labor and emphasis on protecting the poor). I‚Äôd expect a mix of firm theology and social engagement: a pontificate marked by robust doctrinal clarity alongside continued outreach to the marginalized.

Edit: expand on some questions I've got.
  50. Prevost has faced criticism from advocates for clergy abuse survivors regarding his handling of sexual abuse allegations during his leadership in the Augustinian order and in Peru. The advocacy group SNAP (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests) has alleged that Prevost failed to act against abuse claims involving Richard McGrath, a former president of Providence Catholic High School, allowing him to remain in his position despite longstanding accusations = business as usual
  51. Oh dear, I hope he's not a MAGA catholic.
  52. Certainly a choice to give the papacy to an American at this point in time.
  53. So it's not the seagull after all. :(
  54. [Papa Americano?](https://youtu.be/7E9Ed9DUQoQ?si=JZqZldHq4gjNIE7R)
  55. This just seems like the ultimate and - unexpected- burn. The wanna be dictator lunatic posts an image of himself as pope.

The conclaves like 'you want an American pope, we'll give you an American pope.'  A guy who already has a pubic record of telling Vance to sod off.

Like they said- Do. Not. Mock. Us.
  56. He was made cardinal by Pope Francis
  57. Damn wonder if he's gonna have beef with trump being an american
  58. Quick Which actor looks like him? Invest now!
  59. mmh the perfect anti-Trump Pope. Music for my ears. He literally has dual-Peruvian citizenship.
  60. Kind face
  61. "Bob Pope, tremendous golfer, not as good as me, but still tremendous." - djt, probably.
  62. His first speech included peace, I am hopeful.
  63. So wait, by electing an American moderate to mildly progressive pope who has been outspoken against maga policies, did the Vactican just troll the trollers in chief?
  64. He looked moved to tears when he was on the balcony waving to people. I wonder what it felt like being up there and seeing all the people celebrating. Becoming a historic figure overnight. He wasn‚Äôt exactly who people thought would be the next Pope.
  65. i mean people screeching that he's not pro women in the clergy or pro abortion rights...uhhh??? this is the catholic church we're talking about. the fact a pope spoke positively about gay people in my life time is a miracle alone
  66. The new pope looks healthy.  Let's hope he lasts long and well and does good things.

"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time   with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

~Thomas Jefferson
  2. Hanging by his feet from a metal girder in Milan. The most suitable end for any fascist dictator.
  3. Best pinata ever
  4. Mate, why did you post his picture up side down?
  5. I love good endings
  6. And Hitler would find his offramp two days later.

Good riddance to bad rubbish.
  7. sic semper tyrannis
  8. Dead fascists are the best fascists
  9. I wholeheartedly recommend watching https://youtu.be/7xhwx8z8mJc?si=EZf-W9OW_91KsuUQ if you don't know much about Mussolini!
  11. why the photo is upside down?
  12. Huh, he looks the lovechild of putin and trump
  13. My grandfather was 12 when this happened and went there with his uncle (he was orphan) by bike from a city a few kilometres from Milan, only to spit on the corpse of Mussolini. A good ol' lesson that I will remember forever from my lovely grampa.
  14. You should have a second slide with the aftermath photo, come on. Easy upvote.
  15. Ceaucescu as well - this is the way.
  16. Trump vs Mussolini: Same Energy, Different Timeline

Similarities:

Populist Vibes: Both played the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like those other losers‚Äù card and convinced a ton of angry people to back them.

Big Strong Daddy Energy: Claimed only they could fix everything because they were "tough" and everyone else was weak.

Flag-Waving Nationalism: Mussolini wanted a new Roman Empire; Trump wanted a 1950s reboot with more flags and trucks.

Charisma > Policy: Less "here‚Äôs a 10-point plan" and more "watch me roast my enemies in real time."

Enemy of the Press: Mussolini controlled the news; Trump just screamed "fake news" until it stuck.

Media Geniuses: One dominated newspapers; the other dominated Twitter. Same idea, different tech.

Differences:

Level of Evil: Mussolini went full dictator (no elections, political murders, war crimes). Trump flirted with authoritarianism but still lost an election and dipped.

Actual Violence: Mussolini‚Äôs Blackshirts beat and killed political opponents. Trump incited a mob but didn‚Äôt institutionalize violence on a national level.

Foreign Adventures: Mussolini invaded countries; Trump mostly just rage-tweeted at Canada and started no new wars.

Real Ideology: Mussolini had an actual fascist blueprint. Trump mostly had vibes, slogans, and loyalty tests.

Timing is Everything: Mussolini rose after a world war and economic collapse. Trump rose after... Twitter made people insane.
  17. That‚Äôs why we sometimes write text upside down to mock current day fascists
  18. I hope people are taking notes.
  19. Our neo autocratic dictators seem to believe that they are immune from such a fate. Or, they are too drunk with power to think about anything in a rational manner.
  20. History repeating itself in the US with the Magas!
  21. Sic semper tyrannis
  22. Trump is a fascist
  23. And nothing of value was lost, rest in piss bozo

He got the fate that's appropriate for fascists.
  24. Do Donald now.
  25. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  26. Why is this photo upside down?
  27. That's what you fucking get. Fuck off fascists, and fuck off meloni and friends who to their worst to intimidate anti-fascists, asking them documents, prohibiting them to sinf Bella Ciao.
  28. Something for all fascists today to consider.
  29. Great stuff, should also happen to all dictators of our time.
  30. Good.

It's a shame people have no spine these days when it comes to fascist leaders. 

But who knows. Maybe I'll see Putty Boy or Orange man's head on a spike someday. ü§û
  31. Note: the body was hung by the partisans at the petrol station in Piazzale Loreto to keep it out of reach for further disfigurement by the angry public and to get even at the fascists, who executed weeks before in the same place a group of partisans extra judicially (not that it makes a difference, since Mussolini already established politicised tribunals outside the official law courts in 1924 and eliminated judicial independence, something that the likes of Salvini and Orban would like to repeat).

The site right now is ironically occupied by a McDonald's.
  32. He was wearing an SS uniform when he was shot by partisans
  33. The picture Is in wrong direction.
Turn it 180 degrees
  34. Rest in piss
  35. üôÉ
  36. Should have been done to Hitler as well.
  37. I'm happy knowing that one day, history will repeat itself.
  38. Time to do the same to Putin
  39. The orange freak should be next
  40. Pay attention, DJT.
  41. It‚Äôs only a shame that other dictators didn‚Äôt meet a similar end. 

Also fun fact, afterwards his body was transferred to a glorious tomb with a giant statue of his face. To this day still being constantly guarded by a neo facist guy. I don‚Äôt get why people haven‚Äôt burned that place down yet.
  42. We can only hope‚Ä¶.
  43. You posted the pic upside down.
  44. Apparently there is still two wall arts of Mussolini in Italy with one of them having the eyes shot off by rebels along side Mussolini monolith and letter M as Mussolini in front of one stadium because, Mussolini liked having letter M everywhere to praise himself among the people.

Also apparently the spot where Mussolini was executed there stands big letter M to this day but that letter M don't stand for Mussolini but for Mc'Donalds. In other words, his execution spot is now Mc'Donalds but hey he got to keep the M at least just not his M.
  45. Should have done that with more fascists.
  46. History offers numerous examples of FAFO.
  47. And we'll do it again and again
  48. He and his wife were hung upside down in the city square.
  49. People knew how to take the trash out back then.
  50. He looks like a fat Stephen Miller
  51. Nice
  52. And they say American's can't learn anything from Europeans
  53. Trump is the fattest fascist I have
  54. His granddaughter blocked me on Twitter for posting a picture of her upside down
  55. people still put flowers at his mausoleum.  and what's equally insane is that he HAS a mausoleum after his crimes.
  56. This is a story all about how,

My life got flipped, turned upside down...
  57. Play stupid games win stupid prizes
  58. As a Canadian heading to the Polls tomorrow to cast a ballot for our national government; this seems; prescient.
  59. Good
  60. Mario when.
  61. Inspirational
  62. Now do the orange imbecile tRump !
  63. #goals
  64. On 28 April 1945, he became a good fascist.
  65. Ya know, if you stick a yellow wig on him, he looks like someone else that's in the news a lot.

[Donald Mussolini](https://i.imgur.com/0x0asuM.jpeg)
  66. Seems like every time travel movie entertains the premise of going back in time to kill Hitler, but don't realize they should go back in time and kill Mussolini to prevent World War II
  67. We should do this more often.
  68. Proud to share my birthday with Mussolini's execution  üôå
  69. Maybe that's why Musk is pushing so much for electric vehicles. Must feel dread for himself and his friends when he passes by a gas station...
  70. Rip bozo
  71. Good times
  72. Happy Mussolini Death AnniversaryüéÇüéÇüéÇ
  73. Pro MAGAts are trying to hide historical evidence of how quickly his fascist regime went down when the masses stood against him.

Say it loud about how expansionist fascists swiftly went out and how brutal their ending was when the people they tortured and abused finally stood up to them.

Mussolini loves that he was publicly disgraced and his mutilated corpse is still shown.

That was his goal.

To live forever and all costs.
  74. putin next
  75. This is the way.
  76. How are we supposed to react without breaking Reddit rules? Feels like a trap
  77. Rip Bozo
  78. This is the way
  79. It will always be among humanity‚Äôs greatest losses that Hitler didn‚Äôt share his experience.
  81. Burn in hell bald*uck.
  82. That can happen to trump
  83. People tend to forget Europe has a nasty way of getting rid of its dictators, the last was publicly executed in 1989 together with his wife - Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. He came to a very sudden end.
  84. well deserved!
  85. I know an upcoming dictator who should be taking notes...
  86. Fuck the fascist.
  87. FAFO
  88. This picture is upside down
  89. So Trump ü§îü§™ü§£
  90. I bet he still preferred that than having to sit through another lecture from Hitler.
  91. As a fairly frequent visitor to the north of Italy, it appears that Mussolini seems still quite popular. I could never understand quite why, as it was a long time ago, but national politics are weird.
  92. I honestly think Mussolini is a better model for modern day illiberalism than the nazis.  He was a fascist without engaging in mass genocide
  93. The end that any dictator or wannabe at it should get!
  94. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  95. It's so worrysome that 80 years later, his party is thriving under Meloni. We must remember what these fiends are capable of. No matter how sweet that hateful populism is.
  96. Man we used to know what to do with dictators
  97. Disfigured Mussolini? What about a Mangled Mango?
  98. A day of rejoice and memory for the brave partisans that defeated him and his ideology. 
Just one more thing to add to the context: he got captured trying to flee to Nazi Germany but got intercepted due to the fact that the partisans already controlled all the road network. So he got captured and executed. 
His body and the ones of his cronies got brought to Piazzale Loreto in Milan, where a year before the fascist regime tried to make an example of 15 partisans by executing them and leaving their bodies there to rot for a couple of days. 
A year later was the turn of Mussolini and his closest associates and his mistress. 
As Mussolini's body got hanged another key figure of fascism, Achille Storace was brought there, forced to witness the end of his dictator and shot on the spot as well. 
All the bodie had to be hung because the people couldn't help themselves but lynching them.
  99. Good

  101. may this serve as warning for dictators
  102. A good day!
  103. Hum. Stephen Miller comes to mind.
  104. The photo is upside down.
  105. Can‚Äôt wait for an annoying orange to get a similar situation or hope for it at the least
  106. Eat shit Benito!
  107. They did deserve, everyone who wants to be a dictator! Should read history!
  108. don't show him like that. show him where he belongs... strung up by his feet at Loreto in Milan
  109. Too late. Unfortunately
  110. Only to have communists take over the EU in the 21st century.
  111. If i were 47 they might want to read this one. He has passed off enough magas deported enough family.
  113. Those were the days, eh lads?
  114. And nothing of value was lost.
  115. To anyone who misses and supports him, Hang in there
  116. Wow, they fucked him up. He looks like Steven Miller.  How could they have known?
  117. Clearly Stephen Miller has the look.
  118. Um dia Andr√© Ventura ü•∞
  119. Sounds like a plan
  120. I hope Mussolini comes back to life...




...so we can do it again.
  121. I believe his granddaughter Alessandra is in politics and she believes the same thing as her grade

Edit: changed name

His great grandson is a soccer player and his name is also Benito, last name Mussolini
  122. Jesus, I see what you‚Äôve done for others and I want that for me.
  123. One can hope for the same outcome in present times to happen to multiple pieces of shit.¬†
  124. They even made an emoji for him and it serves as a good reminder for anyone who aspires to be a fascist üôÉ
  125. Thanks op for giving us Americans something to live for.
  126. I wonder if the history will repeat itself
  127. His head was literally caved in. Bravo Italia!
  128. Plenty modern incarnations that will go the same way.
  129. Sigh
  130. We should do this more often.
  131. As an American in 2025... interesting!
  132. Italians are proud of this but most people didn't start to turn on Mussolini until he let the Germans occupy the country without resistance. 

They were fine with a regular Fascist but not a traitor.
  133. FAFO. Fuck fascism and those who stand for it.
  134. In current Europe he would be elected again..(sadly)
  135. And I wish the same to all fascist / nazi leaders and dictators.
  136. Hopefully we'll get our turn too, and without a world war.
  137. Is there a downside?
  138. Make America post Mussolini Italy again!!
  139. Yup. True statement that
  140. Does his jacket have no lapels?
  142. Thank you for the feel good story this Sunday evening.
  143. Why would you post this picture and not the one of him heels over head?

The whole point of that was to destroy exactly this kind of image and show what tyrants end up as.
  144. History just repeatsüòâ
  145. Would be fascists take note
  146. Good, we need to do it a couple more times thought so Fascists really get the message; they aren‚Äôt welcome.
  147. Today's dicktators are making sure they don't face such consequences
  148. *takes notes
  149. Too bad his war crimes loving, never punished officers and generals didn't get the same, because  they deserved it, but instead nothing happened to them, thx US.
  150. Each picture of him should be posted upside down, to remember what is the right position for a fascist
  152. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge
  153. Sic Semper Tyrannis...
  154. ... (cough)... just sayin'.

*Looks at Trump.
  155. Take note, current (wannabe) dictators.
  156. Why does everyone look like Arne Slott today?
  157. Hmm. History repeats itself?
  159. They say history doesn't repeat but often rhymes.
  160. Only after a world war started because he convinced poor right wing people to die to make him a dictator. They believed him to be a hero even to their deaths. His followers never joined in his death. They hid and taught their children he was a great man.
  161. Hmm. I have an idea üí°
  162. history is full of useful lessons.

this one: how to deal with fascist dictators.
  163. Every dictator forgets how the story always ends.
  164. We hang him upside down with his friends after shooting him and his mistress. The proper ending for a fascist.
  165. i have one wish üíõüïØÔ∏èü™Ñ please
  166. The photo's upsid down
  167. Got the Trump arms crossed belligerent tough guy thing going on. Chances are they‚Äôll end up the same way.

  170. Bteven Miller..
  171. https://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicanPedophiles/s/8D1CYzi0vu

  173. All tyranny fails, all tyrants fall.
  174. Reminds me of Doug Mastriano
  175. "This is not a cornhusk doll dipped in blood in the moonlight like what happened in America."
  176. I just realized I had no idea what Mussolini looked like
  177. LIKE MUSSOLINI!!¬†
  178. But he made the trains run on time‚Ä¶. Perhaps trump should take note.
  179. Apparently they told him he was being rescued when they got him out of the room.  He was all happy thinking his friend Adolf was saving him again.
  180. Hummm‚Ä¶
  181. THIS is what a fascist bafoon deserves!!!¬†
  182. Sounds like a good plan.
  183. if only

  185. Run it back
  186. Those were the days.
  187. The picture is upside down
  188. Sounds like a plan!
  189. Would be lovely if that happened to a modern day fascist leader.
  190. The bare minimum for a fascist
  191. He looks to have gotten better somewhat
  192. Fuck yeah. 52nd Garibaldi communist partisans FTW!
  193. People can only hope
  194. That‚Äôs how all fascists should end up
  195. I could Google this, but redditors provide better, or at least more entertaining answers, so

name a dictator who died peacefully of old age in his bed surrounded by friends and family.
  196. we have a saying here in Brazil, it roughly translates to "the fascist's hat is a hammer"
  197. Don‚Äôt give people ideas.
  198. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini): 

In the evening of 28 April, the bodies of Mussolini, Petacci, and the other executed fascists were loaded onto a van and transported south to Milan. On arriving in the city in the early hours of 29 April, they were dumped on the ground in the¬†[Piazzale Loreto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Loreto), a suburban square near the¬†[main railway station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milano_Centrale_railway_station).[^(\[51\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-55)[^(\[52\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Bosworth332-56)¬†The choice of location was deliberate. Fifteen partisans had been¬†[shot there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Loreto_massacre)¬†in August 1944 in retaliation for partisan attacks and Allied bombing raids, and their bodies had then been left on public display. At the time, Mussolini is said to have remarked "for the blood of Piazzale Loreto, we shall pay dearly".[^(\[52\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Bosworth332-56)

Their bodies were left in a heap, and by 9:00¬†a.m. a considerable crowd had gathered. The corpses were pelted with vegetables, spat at, urinated on, shot at and kicked; Mussolini's face was disfigured by beatings.[^(\[53\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Luzzatto68-57)[^(\[54\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Moseley313-58)¬†Allied forces began arriving in the city during the course of the morning and an American eyewitness described the crowd as "sinister, depraved, out of control".[^(\[54\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Moseley313-58)¬†After a while, the bodies were hung by their feet from the metal girder framework of a half-built service station.[^(\[53\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Luzzatto68-57)[^(\[54\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-Moseley313-58)[^(\[55\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-59)¬†This mode of hanging had been used in northern Italy since medieval times to stress the "infamy" of the hanged. However, the reason given by those involved in hanging Mussolini and the others in this way was to protect the bodies from the mob. Movie footage of what happened appears to confirm that to be the case.[^(\[56\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Benito_Mussolini#cite_note-60)

  1. Erdogan is pressing all buttons to silence us
  2. The official symbol for the AKP(Justice and Prosperity Party) which is the party of Erdoƒüan who has been in power for 23 years and counting, is the lightbulb.
  3. We‚Äôre proud of you, brothers and neighbors! Keep fighting for the rule of law and respect for human rights‚Äîfuture generations will be grateful to you.
  4. Why is it that these so-called strong men dictators are so weak that they fear their own people.
  5. Beautiful!

Wish the Turkish people can throw out this idiot. I want to come back and visit again soon and it's frankly putting me off.
  6. I genuinely have the utmost respect for everybody there.
  7. I love this. I seriously hope they win, maybe teach us Americans a thing or two ;___;
  8. Incredible display of resilience and unity. Even in darkness, the people‚Äôs determination shines through‚Äîliterally. A powerful message about standing up for your rights no matter the obstacles
  9. Beautiful!
  10. Your president is a thief. He took all the stars in the sky and put them ON THE STREET.
  11. Turkish government inadvertently sets perfect conditions for protest to look magical and inspirational.

that being said, should probably ration the power on those batteries
  12. I dot think that they really thought that one out. Someone said let‚Äôs shutdown all the power and light at night that will get them. It‚Äôs now 2025, literally every single person is walking around with a flashlight in their pocket.
  13. Wow. I know this is because of horrible injustice, but *man.* The picture's absolutely beautiful.

Good luck Turkey, we're rooting for you!
  14. Woe that's beatutiful
  15. Haha, get fcked Erdogan
  16. Enacting collective punishment on the people that live in the district for not having done enough to prevent the protests I see
  17. They have the plant but we have the power.  Lisa Simpson
  18. "But the true victory , my son, is to stir the hearts of your people".
  19. Wow
  20. They are so courageous and wonderful!
  21. YOU GOT THIS, TURKEY
  22. Light at the end of the tunnel.
  23. Damn, I like these guys.

I don't share language, ancestry, or history with the Turkish people.

But... they love the shit out of their dogs and they love the shit out of their cats.

That's good enough for me.
  24. All the light we cannot see - this is the most important light. The light from within!
  25. Imagine if we all stopped hating each other, based on religion, nationally, and, of course, personal stuff. We'd take away all the ammunition all politicians use.
  26. I was flying out of Antalya airport on Friday night and there was what sounded like thousands of car horns going off in the car parks, was that related to the protests?
  27. Turkish protesters really have something to be proud of.
  28. Light in the darkness
  29. now THAT is an image of strength, that's one to save for later
  30. How come all the phone LEDs have nearly the same color temperature? I'd expect at least some discrepancy between manufacturers
  31. The old rulers try their best to rule with force, pushing us into a dark future teaching is to light the way forward with our peers in group solidarity because we ARE the country which we call home as such the leaders should be beholden to us. 

Beautiful
  32. I‚Äôm reminded of the hippie colony in Copenhagen that the government tried to shut down in the 1970s by turning off its electricity. It‚Äôs still going strong 50 years later.
  33. A million points of light.
  34. Damn kids these days, always on their phones
  35. And unintentionally they created **legendary** publicity for the opposition. Seriously, those photos wouldn't be so interesting, people wouldn't get so fired up if the governor simply sat down and did nothing.
  36. This resistance is so inspiring. üí™
  37. Powerful picture! Keep it up! üí™
  38. This is so cool. Power forward!
  39. At least they aren‚Äôt blaming the power outages on some solar event that didn‚Äôt happen‚Ä¶
  40. Keep fighting my friends!
  41. As resistance increases, the brightness of the bulb decreases.
  42. It's beautiful...
  43. Watch my fellow Americans, this is going to be us soon.
  44. Wow
  45. How stupid is the person who ordered this, in an age when everyone has at least one multifunctional flashlight (+computer, camera and kitchensink) in their pockets with a battery that lasts several hours.
  46. *Insert that gif of DiCaprio pointing at the TV*

Oh! They‚Äôre doing the stars thing like the serbian students!
  47. If there are about 1000 people with their smartphone flashlights on in the image, the estimated total power being used for these lights is likely in the range of 50 watts to 100 watts. Just saying.
  48. Bir g√ºn hepinizin amƒ±na koyacaz bekleyin
  49. European Union governments support Erdogan for their own interests. Together with Erdoƒüan, they are exploiting the enlightened part of Turkey.
  50. Where is the "it's ironic" gif?
  51. Luckily this won‚Äôt help today, maybe he‚Äôll need to fake another coup.
  52. are people in the west able to?
  53. Context?
  54. Which city was this?
  55. Now he sees even better how many there are without seeing who they are. That was nice of him.
  56. Congratulations to Erdogan for providing his opposition with the kind of shots made for hogging the spotlight.

Keep it going people.
  57. what is this, the 50th protest against Erdogan?
  58. Every dictator finds his end.
  59. Stay strong, it is amazing what you are doing the last couple of months.
  60. Crazy
  61. Australian here, bloody love youse all!
  62. It's really sinking into dictatorship
  63. It's so beautiful
  64. I hope they keep up the fight, they will need all the resources and help they can get, eventually not even the sun will be able to silence them.
  65. TURKEY!!!!
  66. That smells like desperation.
  67. Easy, they'll just start burning shit most likely
  68. It‚Äôs like cancer is spreading all around the world.
  69. Another disinformation effort. If the government has cut off all electricity, why are the buildings and street lights working?
  70. Neat, CIA is doing the Shawarma Revolution next
  71. Do these protests really change anything? Because so far it did not stop ordinary protestors getting arrested nor did Erdogan let the opposition out of prison...
  72. Why are you trying to overthrow him?
  74. So why am I seeing ads for Turkiye with all this tumult
  75. Erdogan won't go with these protests I'm telling you. We had several chances with votes. %52 voted insistently even after a disaster not caused by earthquakes but given zoning permits to unqualified buildings by bribery of Erdogan regime. More than 50k people died that day yet %90 of Mara≈ü voted for the same regime. My people are miserably dumb and as loyal as dog. The only way is to wait for the brainwashed dinosaurs to get old enough.

**Title:** 21 years ago, ten European countries joined the European Union, finally reuniting with the rest of Europe. No matter how imperfect or perfect our union may be, let us be proud of it!

  1. Back then I was part of an information and welcome campaign. It was such a positive time for Europe. The Union grew we talked about a European constitution.

We need that positivity and confidence back. We knew it would be a challenge to expand by 10/12 countries but it has paid off. Central Europe is so much more prosperous today.
  2. Thank fuck we're in. Whatever issues the EU may have, generally I'm a big fan of it and it's certainly led to a lot of prosperity and development here. We're still some of the poorest in the EU but life is nevertheless a lot better than in the countries that are still trying to get in.¬†
  3. Ireland had been part of the EU since the 1970's, have to say that 50 years of membership has done wonders for our country.

I hope our Eastern European neighbours already see the same massively positive transformations happening in their countries now.
  4. As a Pole I can say that joining EU is the best thing that happened to Poland in modern history, together with joining NATO.
  5. The European Union is the greatest civilizational achievement, we just need to free ourselves from the influence of the USA and develop the military industry.
  6. Best day in history.
  7. I hate only one thing about it... Them implementing veto instead of 2/3 vote.
  8. Hopefully we can also join you at some point! üá≥üá¥‚ù§Ô∏èüá™üá∫
  9. Imperfect is also something that hasn't been completed. 

The EU being imperfect in that sense is a compliment and something to be proud of
  10. So hear me out.

Since I've been on this subreddit I've voiced my opinions in a more ore less heated tone, some people will surely look at my feed, but this is a wonderful opportunity to tell you what this means pesonally to me, as someone from a country where gangsters ruin us and supposed to (falsely) represent the people.

Since I've been a person who forms their own, independent thoughts and reasons I've been calling myself more and more European than Hungarian for example. Sure, I belong to a nationality and sure I have a home country, but I feel like the EU represents the best side of all of us. The cooperation, the opportunities, the fact that we could move on from senseless wars and conflicts and prosper together. I love living here, on the continent, I love the fact that I can move and retire in any states as I wish, and I view the same thing with other EU citizens. We all share a such a colorful history together, let it be good or bad and the fact that this union exists is the livig testament I think to what us Europeans can do together.

I don't care about what generalisations politicians can bring onto a whole nation, or however tense some situations may be, the common European man will always be kind, open, and passionate about one another.

So as a last note, thank you EU, for being the basis for the best of humanity, and thank you for being my personal light of hope in a world that sees so much negativity and despair. I hope one day we'll be able to be a respected part of humanity's brightest community.
  11. Time to listen to Ode to joy
  12. A united Europe is a strong Europe.

Brothers without borders üçª
  15. vive l'Europe

I feel as much European as Slovenian.

I love Europe, I think it's home of the best traditions, customs, lifestyle, freedom, and ideas.

But we must strive to become even stronger and even more connected. Many are jealous of us and feel threatened by us, so they are doing everything in their power to destroy us.
  16. And one day the U.K. will be back in!
  17. Miss you guys

  20. *cries in Brexit*
  21. Congratulations! We Europeans stand united!
  22. As a polish woman, I am proud to be European
  23. Still angry that so many morons in my country (UK) voted to leave.  Maybe one day we can come back and get on with things.
  24. üá™üá™üíôüá™üá∫
  25. This changed everything, this elevated us almost to the level of Western Europe.
  26. Long live the union!
  27. Putin and Trump want to destroy it‚Ä¶ which means that it is really good!
  28. Hey guys, I'm Australian, and I wish we had some sort of comrade stuff going in on. I wish I gelt this european love. I don't even know who we are allied to. Can I please get some memes or something? I'm struggling down here. I  wish we were euro aligned.

Edit: I am also aboriginal, I hate it here.
  29. So grateful to be part of it! üñ§‚ú®
  30. Only 21 years. People bitch and moan about Europe not acting as a unit, but for some us living memory includes massive wars, genocide, dictatorships, totalitarianism, revolutions and a continent divided by walls and fences.

It's insane how f-ing far we've come in a lifetime. Most of us now share a currency, and we're free drive from the Atlantic coast all the way up to the Russian border.
  31. I'm from Poland; our accession to EU is probably the best thing (after regaining independence in 1918 and 1989) that happened to our country in centuries.

I'm forever grateful for that.
  32. I miss you guys üòû

  34. I remember that night‚Ä¶ was active in politics back then! We partied like crazy!
  35. As a Romanian, joining the EU is one of the biggest achievements in our history. And we need to be carefull and hold on to it like our lives depended on it, because the alternative is inconceivable.
  36. 
Hey /u/Matas_-,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
  37. Please send help
  38. I think you can say the EU is the best thing to have ever happened to Europe
  39. Such a sad day it was and still carries on in our hearts.
  40. My friend was so convinced that a united Europe is the future, he converted ALL his money to Euros. Looking back, I was naive, too. I am old now; I can see things I did not see before. An invisible force has been working tirelessly to destabilize and weaken it.
  41. Hope we'll join the family fully some day ü•≤üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá™üá∫
  42. Long Live The Union üá™üá∫ü´°
  43. And there should be rules around unanimity.
  44. Stronger together
  45. As someone from the UK,  I really hope we can celebrate our return anniversary one day too!  Everyone has their idiots in their country,   ours has more than plenty,  but that tiny margin of people who thought they were doing something good for their kids are the ones would would now vote us back in very quickly I think.
  46. I had been in Iceland for a few months before it became official, and saw commercials for ‚ÄúThe European Union initiative‚Äù and thought, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way this will actually happen, right?‚Äù.

But by golly, you went and pulled it off. Well done, my friends.
  47. Ireland only joined because of some funny business
  48. Reuniting? what lol
  49. I remember that as if it were yesterday.

I wish we could go back just one day.
  50. Such a powerful milestone in European history! Reuniting after years of division shows the strength of unity, cooperation, and shared values. No union is perfect, but the progress made over the past 21 years is something to be proud of!
  51. "Proud" is a strong world. The EU does nothing for 3rd world countries and people that suffer. The EU doesn't even do anything for the corruption in the Balkans and Mediterranean countries.

I'm happy to be in the EU, but I'm not "proud" in any way. We could have been much, much better.
  52. The union that looks the other way when people who are in danger beg for help
  53. I want to leave the globalist hellhole that's EU. I want my nation back. I want my autonomy back. I want politicians that serve my country's interests not foreigners.
  54. I admit that I was very scary and skeptical b/c I was afraid things like 'Orban vetoeing everything' had bigger chances to happen.

But now, after years of ruzzian war of aggression in Ukraine, I think it was worth to make ex-Warsaw pact nations join a free and democratic EU, as opposed to risk them becoming ruzzian satellites again.

(most joined NATO btw, so their priorities are quite clear)
  55. Great! Now please ask to Hungary to get out.
  56. Never seen so much paid accounts in one thread
  57. Yes, to hell with all borders and different currencies. I love Europe!
  58. In our university the former Polish dissidents turned university professors joked about getting drunk and celebrating when Poland and the enlargement candidate states officially joined the Union on May 1st 2004 at the time
  59. Love the EU. Full stop.
  60. Estonia is proud of it!!
  61. As an American I am cheering you on. Be proud.  Be independent.  Stand up for your culture and way of life.  Don‚Äôt let Trumpism infect you as it‚Äôs killing us.
  62. We need to talk about a European Constitution again. Europe needs to be the Protector of individual rights within each member state. It needs its own taxes, social safety nets and a common defense. Rule by qualified majority and no more vetos.
  63. It's not perfect but there's no better alternative for Europe. We just need to calibrate.
  64. Any union means strength in numbers. This is why trump and putin is trying to tear the EU apart.
  65. Hopefully the Western Balkan states will be allowed to join soon.
  66. EU is now the leader of the free world.
  67. If you want to see what happens when you're not in the EU look at Georgia or Belarus. None of the former Warsaw pact countries would be as developed as they are now without the EU. Unfortunately massive propaganda efforts are being made to make people forget about that so that we're easier to divide.
  68. I will die on the hill that Brexit is the dumbest fucking thing my country has ever done (since colonial times*)
  69. That was a beautiful day.
  70. How about you guys go do something about Ukrain/Russia?  London is literally closer in distance to Kyiv than Los Angeles to New York by over 1,000 miles.
  71. could we say that EU has followed both Delian and Hanseatic League pattern when they put the foundation of EU?
  72. ‚ÄúReuniting‚Äù?
  73. Allways proud of the Achievments the EU has brought us. Loving life here ‚ù§Ô∏è
  74. Not that i am against it but how it is 

# reuniting?

#
  75. You are giving me an example of that. I give you example of what Hungary and Slovakia are doing right now.
  76. How has it benefited the likes of Germany and France who had good economy‚Äôs beforehand?
  77. Unity over separation. We are stronger together.
  78. Brexit is pure unfiltered retardation. Hope to come back one day.
  79. for baltics, seeing the fate of belarus and ukraine compared to us really makes you wonder how terrible our countries would be if not for the western aligned and in EU states

many freedoms we take for granted every day would be something we'd get to only dream about, and probably by now any attempt to join EU would be thwarted by russian meddling not to even mention they could launch a convenient border dispute, we were lucky to join EU early on before russia started gaming EU accession of its neighbors
  80. ‚ÄúReuniting‚Äù?
  81. Reuniting?
  82. I'm just an ugly American, but I think the EU was a great step in the right direction. I might have a spray-tanned cup of lard for a president because of a few of our boondock states, but we're always stronger for being together.
  83. I‚Äôm not sure how to react to this anymore.

  84. Atleast we dont have paranoid and delusional dictator like they have beyond the big sea.üôè
  85. EU that promotes democracy and freedom, but only on paper. Openly supporting and  funding with loans the dictatorship regime of Aleksandar Vucic because they need fucking lithium.
Turning their head the other way on freedom of press, speach, political arests and violence againsts people. Because EU cares about their basic principles and thats lithium
  86. If trump were to deport me to Germany I wouldn't even be mad.
  87. Coming from USA after 35 years living there, the life in Europe is like I died and went to heaven!
  88. Starting with the leaders that no one elected! Above all, these despicable beings hate human beings, they hate the common European and want their annihilation, they want total control of the natural resources of all of Europe, you only have to look at the laws they make to understand their black and satanic intentions, but it is because of people like you that these dark evil beings govern that no matter what bad things these nefarious people are doing, we must call for false patriotism and false pride! Wake up and better make a call to return to the true value for which the European Union was founded and not this, which is just a plan to create a communist social Europe where you will have nothing and you will be happy!
  89. I personally consider the EU to be a primitive version of what I refer to as a meta-civilisation. A forum in which individual civilisations hold consensi for collective activities. I like to think about what the first true meta-civilisation may be like
  90. Hope Canada can join the EU at some point as well. We share the same values, freedoms critical to human life are at the core of our ethos, and we believe in a conflict-free future with basic human rights taken care of. Love travelling to EU often and I‚Äôm enamoured by your love for life and food. We could do with some more of it here!
  91. I‚Äôd love to be able to celebrate, but unfortunately 39% of the UK (53% majority of 73% turnout - 1.9m votes) voted to leave, and the rest of us can now proudly clutch our navy blue passports (which I do actually like) and stand in the long slow clue to enter our nearest neighbours üòî
  92. Why should we be proud of the EU becoming poorer?
  93. And yet most of the adults in the country that I live in are dumb fucks who thought that we'd do better not in the EU yet we're now suffering because of them
  94. Implying everyone who didnt join magically disappeared from the continent?
  95. I'm from a country that isn't in the EU. What are the benefits of joining the EU as a european country? I'm not anti-EU, I just don't know anything about it. Another question would be what would benefits be for a rich or well developed nation to join the EU? Like obviously I know why a hypothetical super poor f'd up shithole country might want to join it.
  96. With the US becoming divided and toxic, it's important that Europe remains tolerant and united.
  97. You guys should be proud of it. Imagine a united army that will protect its people. Not carrying that for most of its history y‚Äôall been fighting against one another, but for right fucking now. Right now, you will be a superpower and if you let go of the US, you will become one. I have faith in my European brothers. Don‚Äôt fail me.
  98. This is the way.
  99. Congrats everyone from Germany:)
  100. American here. Sorry about our new stepdad. He doesn't have a job (but spends all moms money), doesn't wear black to funerals,  meddles in everyone else's divorces, puts a fence up (even though we like the neighbor kids), beats the foster kids living here, is kind of racist, kicks out everyone to the streets even if there is no where to go, thinks everyone's trying to sleep with our mother, thinks everyone else should bring their own name-brand food/drink to the BBQs ( but brings off brand/if anything thing to y'all's), keeps letting his creepy uncle Musk into our house and he hurts us, and even though he hits mom and accused her of cheating on him she keeps letting him back into the house. (Help)
  101. Yea if only countries like GERMANY didn‚Äôt SHUT DOWN THEIR NUCLEAR PLANTS(????????????? Tf is wrong with you), causing prices for electricity to surge in other countries who are unfortunate enough to have hooked their power grid up to EU through ACER, I‚Äôm sure norway would be slightly more inclined to join EU, otherwise, kindly fuck off lol
  102. It‚Äôs a model for future generations. One of the first times in human history where sovereign nations ceded individual power for the sake of unity (and ultimately, more power together)
  103. I miss being in it üò≠
  104. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I miss EU15
  105. Our diversity will be our superpower, but we need to become better and BUYING AND SELLING from one another. Any business that wants to sell to the wider market should have an English-language version of their website and REASONABLE trans-EU shipping costs.

I think the EU needs to do more to bring down the cost of shipping in Europe.
  106. More important than ever
  108. Sounds gay
  109. Oh yes, let us be happy about a distant, non-elected bureaucracy handing down rules to disparate countries and peoples! Oh look it's really controlled by the Germans and French. I'm sure I've heard that idea somewhere before.
  110. *Cries in British*
  111. You've ruined the whole of western civilization.
  112. Honestly, we should have been A LOT more selective. There were a few good additions, like the Baltic states, who are doing surprisingly well for themselves and seem to love the EU, while having great potential for the future. How ever, adding Hungary and Poland wasn't such a great idea. It feels like we are about to make similar mistakes again. I still can't believe that we consider places like Bosnia and Serbia candidates. The Balkan nations largely do not share our values, politically they are extremely dangerous and what if they go to war with each other? They aren't exactly economic powerhouses either. 

I wonder: What is actually the greater goal? A loose collection of states with nothing much in common?
  113. Europa CARALHO!!!
  114. Holy cringe
  115. I find the EU great but they really missed the opportunity to a create rules for kicking out members easier.

With the current rules it's close to impossible.

Yes, I'm talking about Hungary.
  116. yeah, party | we got old
  117. Why does Europe qualify to be a continent? Isn't it extended asia?
  118. Forgive my ignorance but didn‚Äôt Brexit change this?
  119. What reuniting? They never left Europe
  120. I'm not a part of it though.
  121. "I HAVE A DREAM"- AMERICAN UNION 
MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR.
  122. *laughs in UK*
  123. I hope, through the proper course and gradual (wish it could be done faster) elimination of corruption, Albania üá¶üá±can join this ever-evolving union. There is prosperity in the coming decades, I just know it.
  124. I think the three greatest achievements of the 20th century were the creation of the EU, landing on the moon and the internet.

I hope that someday there is a Latino or American Union from the Rio Bravo to Tierra del Fuego. 400 million Spanish speakers and 200 million Portuguese speakers all with similar values cooperating for the betterment of all the continent with no borders, free flow of goods & services and a shiny new coin called the Latino.

The EU is such a grand and utopian endeavor in my eyes. Amazing what humans can achieve when they cooperate instead of compete.
  125. Man i love it here
  126. Never forget. Europe was constantly at war with each other for literally thousands of years until the EU was formed. Love it or hate it. It's done its first job perfectly. Hopefully some solid modernisation and reform can bring it into the 21st century. Sure. But don't throw it out too quickly. Never take European peace for granted
  127. It's time to ditch the word Union and start calling it Europa, including a flag depicting a princess on a white bull
  128. Why?
  129. Well Hungary is doing its best to fuck it all up
  130. Have France or especially Italy improved? ü§î
  131. Love the concept- from America üá∫üá≤ ‚úäüèΩ üá≤üáΩ
  132. Reuniting?
  133. Or... Let's aknowledge it's flawed, and change it...?

What good does blind appraisal do?
  134. The wording here is extremely disturbing. 
Reuniting as in how?
  135. Couldnt agree more, 
There is no other place In the world, with values like ours I would fight for!
  136. Bljuv. EU drop dead
  137. EU kinda forgot about expansion
  138. The EU is far from perfect. But I remember visiting my family in pre-EU Portugal when I was a kid and the divide in wealth and resources was obvious to me, even as a child. But now, Portugal is so developed and propserous that I sometimes I feel like I'm slumming it here. Lisbon and Porto are GORGEOUS cities and everything is so clean. If it wasn't for the lacking public transit throughout the less urban parts of the country, I'd be willing to move there in a heartbeat.
  139. The ones who make this union imperfect are those who don't believe in its values. Trans-Atlanticists like Schauble and now far-right Euroskepticists bootlicking Trump.
  140. They were lucky that Brussels did not ask Russia's permission at the time.

Today I doubt that the Baltic countries would be accepted with such ease.
  141. I'll be proud to be EU when Frontex has been finally abolished, nothing undermines progressivism at home like fascist brutality at the border, treating the developing world as an outhouse for the soul


Also, tax the fucking rich and provide everyone in our lands with an irreducible minimum standard of living regardless of race, citizenship or religion
  142. Hopefully Ukraine will soon be in both the eu and nato
  143. meanwhile americans refusing to be proud of america despite its flaws:
  144. *cries in British* 
Seriously though I grew up being so proud we were part of the EU and always saw myself as European before British...  

Relish being in the EU and treasure it!
  145. Miss you guys üò≠
  146. Crying in 'UK'.
  147. Please let us in üá¨üáß
  148. Lots of love from the UK. Wishing we were able to rejoin you guys
  149. I wish we'd never left (uk).
  150. As always having a common ennemy is the best way to bond üò≠
  151. There are still a few countries that need to join to finally make Europe whole and united. That will be our greatest achievement as Europeans, from war torn continent to beacon of hope for all humanity.
  152. I wish north America would do the same. Mexico, US, and Canada would be great.
  153. Ok, good. Now let's send Orban and other Putin/Trump (same shit) sycophants go fuck themselves pronto.
  154. This is important.

We still need to do a LOT of work, but we're in the right path.
  155. I Like the eu very much, despite some serious problems with it.

The world order is changing very rapidly and old orthodoxies no longer apply, so
EU must become military power if it wants to survive in the future.
  156. On international Labour day, no less.

Fitting, really, that you'd erase this day for us. The main scheme of EU was to get cheap labour and services by exploiting the poorer countries, while undermining the working class and wages in the richest countries. Of course they framed it as 'helping' the former. The latter, well they 'wouldn't have to do the most menial jobs anymore', they were supposedly too lazy to anyways. 'They should pull themselves up by the bootstraps and get more education, simple as that'
  157. Nothing to be proud of. It has destroyed and is continuing to destroy all of Europe.
  158. "We're managing our decline as one!"
  159. No one is taking about the demographic shock that this had on Eastern Europe population. So many towns have had huge brain drains
  160. In 2026 we will finally send Orban packing and Hungary can become a great country again, I promise. We won't let Orban turn us against the EU and force us to leave.

  1. 7 long months..... I was so tired of this, glad is over and we remain in the european family.
  2. We are still here üá™üá∫üá∑üá¥
  3. It's simiover
  4. So happy for you guys! Cheers from Poland where the today‚Äôs result are not great‚Ä¶ but at least > 75% anti-putin! üá∑üá¥üáµüá±üá™üá∫
  5. Sending congratulations from Budapest!
  6. Meanwhile, the russian doll is on Twitter saying he's the president and that he actually won. That's a level of brain damage you can't recover from, and Europe can't afford this shit to be anywhere near a place of power. Ban the 5th columns.
  7. As Ukrainian I was pretty nervous about these elections. Romania is a massive "silent" helper in our war and overall situation. Im thankful and happy that sanity prevailed.
  8. I'm happy for you, guys!

I hope next year finally we'll finally vote for Europe, too.
  9. Congratulations to Romania!
  10. *Unclench*
  11. I thought my country was no longer mine. I was ready to leave and never come back. I'm so happy I was wrong. Literal tears of joy.
  12. We're less retarded than the USA? What a time to be alive
  13. Russia just lost a lot of money, people may start flying out of windows in Moscow
  14. Faith restored in humanity and in my country
  15. Congrats Rom√¢nia!
  16. Fuck yeah Romania! Love it!
  17. when it's groasa, we stand together.
  18. Romania has done everybody a favor!
  19. Congrats! Well done
  20. Fantastic news. Good job Romania!
  21. Sad Viktor Orban noises‚Ä¶
  22. As someone whose inlaws are Romanian: amazing news. Don't be misunderstood, Simion actually had and still has a very large base of support. Even well educated, well connected and wealthy people I know, and who should understand close ties with the EU are essential for them, voted Simion. I don't think this will blow over without any further incidents, an attempted coupe d'√©tat Jan6 style is unlikely but I hope things remain calm. For now it's time to celebrate and fly the Romanian flag :-). üá∑üá¥üá™üá∫üá∑üá¥üá™üá∫üá∑üá¥üá™üá∫
  23. Great work Romania!
  24. We are proud to be Europeans.
  25. This is a reminder that the conspiracy theorists, the antivaxxers, the uneducated peasants and the general voter base of the far right are still a minority in most societies, as long as the people show up to vote against them. 

Record mobilization of educated, pro Europe Romanians both in Romania and abroad (including apolitical ones who feel disgusted by the whole political scene of Romania) to prevent Simion from becoming president. 

Really happy for my Romanian friends here in Brussels, who were ashamed to share nationality with the Georgescu and Simion masses. They deserve better and they got better in Dan.
  26. Grats Romania(ns)!! Good to see you're interested in sticking together with us. üá∑üá¥ üá™üá∫
  27. Nice. Now cracking social media abuse. 

Slava Romenia
Slava Ukraine
  28. We are drinking till we pass out tomorrow! 

It's Simioff!
  29. LET'S GOOO
  30. Canada, Australia, the Holy See and now Romania have rejected extremism in their elections within the last month. 

The world seems to be healing a bit. I hope this trend continues.
  31. Fly the Azure Field and those 12 Golden Stars people. You deserve it.¬†

  40. I'm really proud to be Romanian right now... fuck yeah...!!!!
  41. Thank fuck. I am so happy for Romania! Away with all these pro-russian oligarchs. Let's work for one united European federation.
  42. Barely. It's still very disturbing how much the other candidate got.
  43. Well Dan Romania!

  60. We have to hope for a better world, not easy these days but we have to believe it‚Äôs possible. Well done Romania!
  61. Gadamn, why did the Putin Onlyfans subscriber got so much? Im happy for you, but next time he should get less than 1%
  62. Got more sense than the UK.
  63. Impressive feat from Dan. Looks like Simeon peaked to early.
  64. Why is Right Wing Populism rising even in countries with very low immigration like Romania ? Genuinely curious
  65. Congratulations from your neighbour, Hungary! Thank you for not electing that barbarian. I believe you made the right choice. Next year we'll do the same!
  66. Much love to all Romanians! I think you did the right thingüá∑üá¥üá™üá∫
  67. GOOD, Congrats to Romania
  68. Romania elected the better person?
  69. Simion can go back to being Ikea furniture ü™ëü™ëü™ë
  70. Cheers from Hungary! You guys did great!
  71. Ah, the sweat sweat cries of russians and americans everywhere. Truly, this is a massive victory for Europe.
  72. Let‚Äôs go Romania! Greetings from Italy! üáÆüáπ
  73. Bravo, from Canada! Well done friends!
  74. That's how it's done!
  75. Good job. Now good luck dealing with the psychos who voted for obvious evil.
  76. Congratulations and cheers to Romanians!
  77. Congrats to all Romanian brothers and sisters!üá∑üá¥
  78. I‚Äôm happy for you guys. Wish the plebs here in the UK hadn‚Äôt fucked out country over.
  79. Cheers, neighbors.
That's great news for us, as well. We need strong Romania to keep going forward together.
  80. Dan! Dan! Dan! Dan! Dan!


Dan! Dan! Dan!
  81. Yet another country smarter than America...
  82. I am so fucking relieved. Thanks guys!
  83. Guys guys we made it
  84. Yet let this be a red flag, an eye opener for Europe that there is an important fraction within Romania who is openly hostile towards the EU. So best to keep this in mind when pushing forward.

Europe can no longer put its head in the sand, and think they can go on as the pre-Trump era. Participation in this unified Europe can bring many advantages yet there are rules that need to be lived by, freedom and equality Europe needs to promote and should never ‚Äúever‚Äù back down on.

Corruption needs to be investigated and severely punished within its ranks, so that the integrity of its office stays for all to see.
  85. Wait for the corruption claims from all the dickheads‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
  86. Amazing!
  87. Very concerning how close this was.
  88. Well then, every bit of good news is a blessing, especially these days. You take it where you can, right?!
  89. This was a milestone. Welcome Romania!
  90. Very nice I like a romania yyes
  91. Thank f..cking god...
2026 can't come soon enough for us.
  92. Good fucking job everyone
  93. Congrats from Poland, now let's hope we (Polish) can pull the same thing in two weeks.
  94. Congrats from Finland! I was nervously following it for a couple of weeks, happy to see that sanity won!
I'll be having tsuica and pufulets tomorrow as celebration üòÅ
  95. Big middle finger to fascism üñï

  99. Thank you Romania!
  100. Congrats Romania!
  101. Good news
  102. A sigh of relief...
  103. Romania has shown Europe we want to continue being part of the European family üíôüíõ we were the best today üá∑üá¥never been prouder!
  104. Well done Romania!
  105. Fucking hell! Glad it‚Äôs over and we keep the EU trajectory. We all aged during this time.
  106. In the last 2 weeks i was unable to sleep well knowing that Simion got 40% (3.8 MILLION) of the votes in the first tour. Now i can finally rest after a great weekeND! üá∑üá¥üá™üá∫
  107. WE WON !!!! LET S GO ROMANIA !!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
  108. Danny boy
  109. LETS GO ROMANIA
  110. Congratulations, Romania and the EU. But deal with the enemy propaganda on social media.
  111. A huge sigh of relief from here in the US!!! 

Nici nu pot sƒÉ ma g√¢ndesc la ce ar fi putut sa fie dacƒÉ era alt rezultat. VƒÉz√¢nd ce se face aici dar acolo »ôi cu rusu in spate.  Traim in timpuri foarte volatile »ôi e nevoie de conducƒÉtori cu cap »ôi inimƒÉ. FelicitƒÉri Romania!
  112. Romanians didn't disappoint. Well played, neighbors!
  113. Congrats.

Now make sure puppets of muscovia don't get a chance to undermine this victory by either overt or more covert means, or else it'd be for naught.

Unfortunately, the battle goes on still.

But if you keep on fighting, you should be able to win it.
  114. Proud to say me and my dad voted for Dan as Diaspora living in the US :)
  115. Bro had 45% votes.. why?
  116. AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA 

THE LOSER MIDGET WILL BE MAD AGAIN

Congrats to the best choice of the two!
Happy you're still with us in the EU.
Greetings from üá∏üá™.
  139. Congratulations my Romanian friends. You are not falling for the same trap a lot of countries are falling right now. At least for now...
  140. Wishing the people of Romania good fortune, good governance, and good health.
  141. only took you guys a hot minute. good stuff.
  142. I'm so fucking delighted even if I'm not Romanian. I know many of them and they're some of the most genuine and welcoming people, it would have pissed me off if their country would elect a pro-Russian piece of shit.
  143. Historic day!
  144. Romania, I love you, but fucking hell, man...
  145. Very uplifting to see. Glad to still have you with us, Romanians!
  146. Congrats, Romania!
  147. Yes
  148. Seems like Trump has set a precedent. Whining and being a sore loser is now the most electoral strategy for the far-right.
  149. It's not done though, people's lives have to be improved over the course of Dan's term otherwise they will manipulate discontent again. That said, I'm delighted with the result
  150. ONE less authoritarian likeü§°,  Hungary‚Äôsüá≠üá∫  Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, Slovakia‚Äôs üá∏üá∞ PM Fico, putin, etcüôèh

All quiet on the Eastern Front!
  154. The European Union is one of the most important alliances in the world! The stronger the better!
  155. ROMANIAAA! FUCK YEAAAH!! 

What a landslide!
  156. fuck russia interference
  157. You went and you have done it ! 

Take a glass and get a nice meal, you deserve to do it.
  158. Congrats to our Romanian friends! Feeling envious after seeing the polls from Poland.
  159. 45+ percent for Simi... It's not a good sign for future.
  160. EASY NICK
  161. Can somebody explain what‚Äôs going on around Romania ?
  162. Our beloved nerd <3
  163. Orban should be afraid with the upcoming Hungarian election as well.
  164. Dub.
  165. It's insane that 45% don't want to.
  166. Great job!! Cheers!!
  167. It's good
  168. At least some positive news on this day, coming from a Portuguese guy.
  169. Holy shit finally some good news.

  172. 9 points up. Nice! In the US it would be a landslide.
  173. In the bin, Facism.
  174. Romania is part of Europe, always has been, always will be. EU <3
  175. Thank god. Congrats friends
  176. Congratulations to  our fellow Hungarians there. I hope next year you could help us to get rid of Orb√°n here...
  177. Now let us do the same in Poland
  178. Congratulations <3
  179. Love you all
  180. why so close :(
  181. Congrats from a fellow French European ! Good job Romania
  182. Congrats Romania!!

We are happy to see you still want to part of the family!
  183. Congratulations fromüá®üá¶
  184. I'm Romanian but lived in Canada for 20+ years, it's the first time I ever voted for a Romanian election. I'm so happy we didn't take the wrong course üí™üí™
  185. Thank goodness!
  186. It was pretty close‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
  187. Well done!
  188. Congratulations from Canada for Holding the Line Romania!  
Salut!
  189. Keep calm and keep up the good fight.


Here in Finland alt right stooges won 2023 elections and got places in regime. After that they lost 2 elections in row. Any piece of responsibility blows these guys apart. Because thats what they are. Bad air.


Nevertheless, keep up good word. Dont share or spread idiotic opinions and messages. Best way to handle trolls is just ignore them. Defend your own turf with smartness and coolness.
  190. Well done! Very happy for Romania but as a fellow Balkan... these results, across the continent, keep getting too close for my comfort....
  191. Well done, Romania! I am so happy for you (and by extension, all of us). FelicitƒÉri!
  192. Thanks to the 1,5 million hungarians who voted against Simion...Hungarians saved Romania lol
  193. I'm so happy for you neighbours! greetings from Hungary!
  194. Well done! Congratulations!
The EU is the best thing that has happened the continent. Well done in fighting the missinformation.
  195. The risk wasn‚Äôt that they would leave, but that they would start sabotaging the EU like Hungary does.
  196. For now, the insane amount of misinformation and propaganda from Russia is still there and still working. We must not forget that 45% decided to vote for a person who made it clear that he wants to end democracy.
  197. Done? How many minutes until that cunt Marco Rubio threatens you for stealing the election?
  198. Wish this was the case for the UK
  199. Romania showing its intelligence when compared to the UK.
  200. It's DAN-da-DAN!

**Title:** President Zelensky had a private audience with Pope Leo XIV
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 27767
**Comments (74):**
  1. Your son was involved in a fight with a fellow student today
  3. This makes me happy.  The Pope has shown the world exactly where his priorities lie.
  4. "Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say you're here sooner than expected."
  5. He can excommunicate Vance, though!
  6. The pope speaking in a Chicago accent to the president of Ukraine is very 2025. Da Bears.
  7. There is a lot of catholics in Ukraine, maybe Leo wants to pay them a visit ?
  8. So what's he going to do? Excommunicate Putin? Order some plagues?
  9. News Headline: "Zelensky has first civil conversation with a level headed American Leader."
  10. There is a third person in the room. Am I the only one seeing this?
  11. Do it.
  12. As an American that supports Zelensky this has me dying lol, no one in this pic is wearing a suit and everyone‚Äôs chill
  13. Do you think the pope is tired of all this stuff? At the end of the day does he just put some shorts on, rip a huge liberating fart and order a burger and fries with glovo? I'd be exhausted

Edit: ops wrong sub, kinda, but whatever
  14. Anyone know what language they communicated in?
  15. I'd love to see Pope Leo XIV release a statement confronting all the Fake Christians out there and marking Trump the Anti-Christ. Giving them a lecture about Fox News, reality, facts, that they're in a cult... etc. The fact that Trump would arrest and deport Jesus if he was here today in America.
  16. 85% of Ukrainians identified as Christians.¬†72% identified themselves with Eastern Orthodoxy, 9% to the Catholic Church (8% Eastern Catholic, 1% Latin Church) and 4% adherents of a Protestant Church or other Christian movement.
  17. Now these are humans who know how to be professional.
  18. pope palpatine
  19. Why does everyone dress like they're going to a funeral when they meet the Pope?
  20. Seeing about a couple of the holy hand grenades.
  21. Interesting definition of private .....
  22. Looks like a black and white photo
  23. An audience so private that the press was there to shoot a picture.  :p
  24. Doesn't look very private
  25. Probably the most genial Pope since John Paul II.
  26. Holy Hand grenades coming in
  27. can't be too private if it's being photographed
  28. I too consider something private when there is a camera crew present.
  29. Not to nitpick, but if it was a private audience then who took the picture?
  31. I was wondering but it turns out theres quite a few catholics living in the east of Ukraine. Which does make sense in hindsight but it still surprised me why the jewish president of a majorly orthodox country would visit the pope.
  33. I‚Äôm not a world leader and this is probably why.  The first thing I would say is ,‚Äùwhat the fuck,  why is god letting this happen?  Why are innocent children being killed.‚Äù
  34. I'm a former Catholic and I approve this message.
  35. "so anyway...I'm the boss now, lol" - pope
  36. A family member tried to tell me years ago that what is happening to Ukraine was justified because they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot a very Christian country‚Äù.
  37. The story begins during a therapy session
  38. Does anyone know why they are meeting? Like besides the war. I thought there were very few Roman Catholics in Ukraine?
  39. Vancie got the brush off
  40. okay?
  41. omg read this twice then- LOL !!!!!
  42. "Is your hand still wet after shaking JD Vance's"
  43. I was told by this sub that he is MAGA because he's from the US?
  44. Warms my heart to see this üíô
  45. And he not death‚Ä¶.Praise the lord
  46. Why is Vance meeting popes so much? Is this normal for veeps?
  47. ‚ÄûI‚Äôll send you a contingent of the Swiss guard to help expel the Russians from your land‚Äú
  48. Divine reinforcements. Can‚Äôt wait to see the holy hand grenade in action.
  49. He‚Äôs not Catholic so why?
  50. give me some money give me some money papa
  51. Pope got no suit?
  52. Orthodox Russia have no regard for human rights.
  53. The amount of aura in this picture is insane
  54. Because the pope refused to see him publicly!
  55. Pope's profile really looks like Palpatine.
  56. Hopefully this visit goes better than JD‚Äôs did‚Ä¶.
  57. Isn't Zelensky (Ukrainian) Orthodox?
  58. Isn't Zelensky jewish?
  59. Jeesus Christ
  60. Why does this sub love photos of meetings of powerful people so much? This post has 1k upvotes and like 10 comments.
  61. Hello
  62. I wonder if God is unable to stop Putin or unwilling to stop Putin?
  63. New Pope really looks badass. BTW, i'm wondering if Zelensky spit on him? /s but I know it's bad /s
  64. Christ, I've watched Andor too many times... Zelensky is speaking with Luthen, a known leader of the rebel alliance.
  65. Why the pop asked an audience from Zelensky?
  66. Can you imagine trying to win a war and dealing with this BS constantly.   
     
Edit:  lol. found all the Trump/Putin loving nazis
  67. zelesnky is a corrupt war criminal
  68. Did he ask for money and weapons?
  69.  Palpatine
  71. The vatican has its own army. Will they be reinforcing Ukraine?
  72. whos buying upvotes for this? 13k ups 200 comment

**Title:** For the current presidential elections in Romania, this is the fourth time in a row that candidate George Simion has failed to show up for a televised confrontation, while Nicu»ôor Dan has always been present.
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 27604
**Comments (166):**
  1. For some reason Simion preferes to go to Poland to get involved in our presidential elections
  2. "Has failed" kind of means that he tried to go but he could not. In reality, he just didn't want to go because he was afraid of Nicusor Dan.

Last time Dan and Simion had a presidential debate, Simion lost 5% or so in the polls*(*=edited)

  
Now the question is: is he going to maintain his lead by not attending these debates or he'll lose even more?
  3. Despite this, he is still on top of polls.


This is the worst world to live


EDIT: since I'm not Romanian, nor I read articles in Romanian, the only sources of information are in English or Italian. Til yesterday, Simion was said as "on top of polls". I saw a poll where "he is no more on top" one minute after posting this. So, don't come to my comment with your finger up and saying "achtually he is not", because I know he is no more, despite a very thin difference; stop commenting this way. And polls are in many cases not indicative of what really people will vote.
  4. A loser who claimed he would attend all the debates, but got knocked out in the first one. Now he‚Äôs running away like a coward because he has no plan ‚Äì just pretends to know what he‚Äôs doing. He‚Äôs going to lose big time. We call him the empty chair ü™ë.
  5. Simion is afraid because he knows he can be much more easily cornered. There are a lot of uncomfortable questions that he could be asked.

Not only that, but he doesn't know how to answer questions about government, economy, etc. No matter what the question is, he always does some mental gymnastics and ends up talking about "those who stole from us all these years".
  6. Oh and the favorite absentee, George Simion, just proposed to finally come again to a debate, but only if his counter candidate doesn't come. I thought it was a joke at first. It seems his previous and only debate he attended got him extremely scared of Nicu»ôor Dan. To be fair he was clearly outperformed by Dan.
  7. Unfortunately it'll probably only bolster his support.


Right-wing populists run on resentment towards the system and rejection of established norms.


Not attending debates is like giving the system and the opposition the finger which is exactly what his base wants to see.
  8. Before the first debate, I‚Äôm pretty sure Simion posted on facebook ‚ÄúI hope he doesn‚Äôt run away‚Äù
  9. Because he is a coward.
  10. Seems like george not found
  11. Meanwhile his fans will go 'Yeah that's cool'.
  12. ND vs Ikea Chair :)))
  13. He learns from his daddy Putin, that is also scared to meet Zelensky in Istanbul
  14. And let me guess, they're still voting for simion?
  15. Like a lot of extremists in the world, they scream at the top of their voices but got 0 solutions. People still vote them cuz they think screaming fixes the issue
  16. The simple fact is some candidates have more to gain attending these debates and some have everything to lose. If you have everything to lose, it's preferable to look bad by not attending rather than attending and risk losing wider support.
  17. HE S A BITCH
  18. Simion is not taking his voters seriously.
  19. It's becoming increasingly clear how much social media influences voting behavior, especially when it comes to the far right. People end up believing any sensational information they see on Facebook, TikTok, or Twitter, without even asking themselves: "Is this true?" The lack of critical thinking and fact-checking turns fake news into absolute truths for some. That's how we end up with leaders elected based on digital manipulation, not real ideas. Social platforms no longer inform, they distort
  20. After Trump completely failed in his debate against Harris, he refused to debate her again. He tried to hide behind saying that he'd do it on Fox News, but Harris called his bluff and agreed. He still refused.

I WISH they would've proceeded with another debate or town hall with an empty chair with Trump's name on it just like this.
  21. Serbia : you guys are having confrontations between candidates?

We have One guy which rules them all.

Police work, doctors work, construction work, judges work, prosecutors work, detective work. Anything you can think of. He is the One. /s
  22. Social Media has people believing in bullshit and fairytale, all in their own bubble of "truth".
  23. SimiOFF
  24. how is Dan's social media campaign? I think it's much more important than TV appearances
  25. He's a coward
  26. Of course, his team is working with our Orban guy: he has not once been in a non-partial debate setting in the last 2 decades, and has won multiple 2/3 majorities thanks to adjusting the rules to his needs. Team Simion follows their applicable recommendations in Romania :)
  27. is this the secret to anti fascism? force speeches and debates and make no shows grounds for disqualification.. top of my head this would have wiped almost all the parties across the world?
  28. Let me guess. The one avoiding the debate is the extreme right candidate?
  29. How the _fuck_ does this guy have a chance to win this?
  30. is that the nazi who is backed up by orban and putin, and half the country loves him?
  31. Let me guess, he‚Äôs the far right candidate
  32. Why the fuck would anyone wanna vote for some chump who's too afraid to even show his face?
  33. That is because he is abroad to try to sway foreing romanians to vote for him.
  34. Which one is pro Russia?
  35. Don't be scared homie.
  36. Because he was made KO in the first debate and most likely someone from his staff advised him to stop showing up.
  37. Just tell your idiot voters how bad the public media is and they will celebrate your cowardice.
  38. It's the same strategy that Fernando Collor and Bolsonaro used in Brasil. They knew that on a debate they could perform bad, so they did not show up until it was one of the big ones. 

Both won the elections anyway. That's the sad part. I really hope in Romania that this strategy will not work and he will lose.
  39. Romanians shouldn't be too shy to liquidate their corrupt leaders like how they treated Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu.
  40. Russia's candidates don't need to show up to Western decadent stuff like election debates. They don't need to.
  41. Well, in Brazil, Bolsonaro didn't show for any debate.

Guess who won the elections that year?
  42. This is not uncommon in Romanian politics. Most high profile candidates no longer go to debates because they really have nothing intelligent to say.
  43. Literally the same tactic that Pellegrini (now president of Slovakia) chose before the election and it might have won him the election.
  44. Just put a screen there and show his 3 most prominent lies, afterwards debunk them.  
He doesn't need to be there to be defeated.
  45. Now it's a meme in Romania to show an empty chair with his name on it. We are doomed if George Simion wins.
  46. The soviet propaganda on facebook, tiktok works better than a tv show...
  47. Simion is really going on the Orb√°nian route. Last time cloisterpig had a debate was in 2006 which cost him an election. He will not make the same mistake by going up against oppo candidates. He just invalidates them using Russian tactics.
  48. Hopefully Nicusor wins the election but lets be real if Simion becomes President it's not like he has a lot of power. In Romania the President is more a ... mascot. He has the power to propose some people in the judicial branch and other bullshit but at the end of the day he needs the Parliament to have any sort of leverage in his plans and currently Simion (or Nicusor) don't have anyone in the Parliament they can do big stuff with.

Romania is a Parliamentary State (Edit: Semi-Presidential, but the power lies with Parliament) not one run by the President like the United States. So the damange an idiot like Simion would do is minimal. It would be bad for our image to have an idiot in charge, but it's not like its the first time our politicians made Romania a laughing stalk to westerners or the US.

**I would LOVE to see debates for Parliamentary Elections, those are the ones that matte**r in Romania and most of the world. Not this bullshit mascot race. Romanians have an unhealthy love for voting for their President as if that will have any change in their lives, and yet they vote the same idiots more or less in the Parliament for 30+ years. Paradoxical don't you think?

All of the Presidents attributes rely on good cooperation with the government and parliament, and guess who votes for those people? The dumb masses who have voted the same idiots in their comfy government and parliament chairs for 30+ years.

So yeah i am very indiferent as to who wins as it won't have much effect on my day to day life. Romania already is becoming a shithole due to idiotic government and parliament, it can't get much worse.  But I would also like for Nicusor to win since he seems like a cool guy.
  49. Ok, but what are those balls and why is Dan looking at them with such longing?
  50. He was busy meeting other european far right people.
  51. He will skip all of the already agreed upon televised confrontations because he got his ass handed to him during the first one they were both participating to, that he realized (or someone with a half neuron extra) that to keep showing up during this week would just mean bad news for him. 

Regardless, Nicusor Dan is now leading the polls (as he should).
  52. this is so typical :(. The dumb, aggressive, uneducated groups are ashamed to stand up and speak up, but they keep their resentiment and hatred silent and stubbornly elect the dumb, aggressive, uneducated candidates.
  53. At a local level as well as at an european level, drastic measures against social media propaganda must be taken immediately. I'd argue even for out right banning all social media platforms for a while or at least drastically reducing what you can post on them.

Unlimited access to information has been taken hostage/gone rogue and people are firehosed by disinformation and aggression and all constructive dialogue is being suppressed by all means possible. 

Corroborated with an ever growing lack of real education and ability to properly sort through fact or fiction when it comes to information, people are exposed to all manners of risk, from voting for extremists to refusing proven science, vaccines and trying dangerous treatments that they've read about. And things are getting increasingly worse year by year and social media si proving time and time again that it's the most powerful tool. We nearly elected a pro-Russian half-wit nobody last year in our presidential election just because he had a massive tiktok propaganda in the last 3 weeks of campaign, leaving far behind candidates that worked tirelessly throughout the year all around the country. It's insane!

The EU should really invest in providing it's own social media service and messaging apps and trying to disconnect asap from TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and all these unregulated platforms before they tear apart the very fabric of society. 

Also BOO! Simion, he absolutely sucks, is a schoolyard bully, has 0 real politics and solutions and for all his "bad boy, hardass" persona he's proven to be a coward.
  54. So the russian asset is copying Trump‚Äôs debate-dodging playbook. Honestly, there should be a law in every democracy: if a candidate skips a set number of televised debates, they‚Äôre disqualified from running.
  55. I really do hope for all Europeans and Romanians that this will cost him the election.
  56. He s cutting the leaves for dogs
  57. Let's hope Romanians get their shit together on this one.
  58. Oh we had that before and he won
  59. On political BBC panel show Have I Got News For You, Labour MP Roy Hattersley did not turn up/refused to appear, and he was replaced by a tub of lard. The show credited it as "The Right Honourable Tub of Lard, MP"
  60. why the fuck do people even vote for him
  61. Marcos JR got away with this in the Philippines. Didn't attend one single debate, won the election.
  62. When guests have done this on the UK current affairs quiz show [*Have I Got News for You*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_I_Got_News_for_You), they've instead put an embarassing object in the guest's place, including;  
  
[**A Tub of Lard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX-eJq8IUM4&t=57s)
  63. Hungarian here, Orb√°n has not been to any debate since maybe 2004? I don't know exactly, but it's been decades. And he is is still ruling with 2/3. The lack of debate does not do jack shit when your followers are mindless goons.
  64. He REFUSES to show up, he's a spineless coward and the idiots will still vote him for president
  65. Let me guess.. George Simion is the conservative candidate? This same shit happened recently with literally all conservative candidates across the country with our recent elections in Canada.

Edit: newsflash, they lost.
  66. I know absolutely nothing about Romanian politics and can already guess the guy skipping debates is conservative or hard right. They‚Äôre all cut from the same cloth.
  67. ü™ëü™ëü™ë
  68. Populists don't feel the need to debate, they can get their message across through social media and tweets and whatever platform they choose, they'd melt down when fact-checked in real time and facing an equal opponent. 

Frankly I don't understand why this is left as their choice. I'd make it compulsory and well-regulated, not up to the whims of the participants and the network hosting it.
  69. The average aur voter is the town's retard.
  70. Now do one with Putin empty chair in Istanbul
  71. If I was him I would just bring a doll with a Russian flag for the next debate and place it on the chair and have a debate with it easy W
  72. Reminds me of the good old days when Clint Eastwood was at a right wing convention debating an empty chair.
  73. was he stucked in the traffic?
  74. This happens in Missouri too... the Republican congresspeople are such goombas that it might hurt their 70% win if they actually show up to a debate!
  75. Is this  a sign of a rigged election if George wins? Please, Romania, don't vote for George! I have Romanian colleagues who are worried and don't know why this is even a possibility
  77. Slightly off topic, why do they have a bowl of water balloons? Maybe Simion didn't want to get wet.
  78. Always been present, always responded to every question right, nothing from Nicusor Dan‚Äôs speech/ideas doesn‚Äôt make me not wanting him to be the president.
  79. Help he looks so sad üò≠
  80. When people don't turn up, they should just have a balloon face to take their place.
  81. In Slovakia, winners of parliament and presidential elections were both dodging debates and still won. People just don't care. They prefer posting videos to Facebook where they can just say whatever they won't without any pushback.
  82. Just like Putin..
  83. I'll go vote for Nicu»ôor, even if i dont live in romania. We need to get rid of these populist scumbags.
  84. Just like in Greece with Mitsotakis being afraid to debate Tsipras one on one. Really says a lot
  85. This is a proven scenario. Vucic did not have any debate with other candidates. Trump quit after the first one against Kamala. Orban same story i think. 


Long story short, Romanians, look at what happens in Serbia (corruption) and Hungary (debt), and first go to the polls, second choose wisely! 

Greetings from Belgrade.
  86. He's using the same tactic as Trump with Harris, if you know you're gona get trounced just refuse to go
  87. Well that makes sense, he can only lose when he opens his mouth. Dan is on a completely different level.

Simion will dodge as much as possible and use his russian bot network to spam disinfo online instead. Same strategy as trump.
  88. This is his brand from now on üòÖ
  89. It's always the same:far right populists avoid confrontation because they know their popularity is all based on fake-news, BS-propaganda and social-network "tam tam".  
I'm afraid he will win and Romania will replace Hungary, where people after many years have finally seen Orban's bluff, as Putin's Trojan Horse inside the EU. That's sad, because Romania is a country with a good potential and he will pull it back to many years ago.
  90. Why would he show up to a TV debate? he's too busy stealing this election.
  91. Simion and Putin have something in common, both have the need for power and flee when facing the problem
  92. And the vote is somehow fuckin split in polls?
  93. And yet people still vote for that bitch.
Why ? Because apparently corruption and criminals are not as big of a concern as "da gae people" to the general population, and that apparently Nicu»ôor supports them .

I see them and hear them on the street and on the bus ...
People's value systems are messed up.
  94. I starting to think that all this far right guys like Putin,Simion,Fitso and Orban are just TV celebrities that use slogans and live in endless TV-world where everyone loves them
  95. Here is a glimpse of the future for you. We have same President/prime minister for 13 years now. Never was in a studio with someone who is not a paid journalist by his party. All he does are guest appearances when he has a de facto monologue or he addresses the public when he has a real monologue. And announcements... There was a murder or an arrest, fuck police generals or ministers he will tell us what happened. There was a medical emergency, fuck doctors or minister of health he is there in white coat to tell us what happened. There was a blizzard and people got stuck on the highway, fuck emergency services there he is jumping out of black mercedes in leather shoes grabbing a kid from parents in the car and he disappeared in the snow like a hero in the night saving him (im not even joking, just so happens that a TV crew from one of his paid journalist was there to capture that on camera). Once one of those journalists dared to ask him a question he did not approve before he had a meltdown and told his voters that that television went rogue and can't be trusted anymore. He always calls for dialogue and discussion but NEVER in those 13 years have I seen him in a studio with a member of the opposition party. And just last year he had more television appearances than there are days in the year. Good luck to you brothers and sisters in Romania if you do not stop this you will need it.
  96. The same happened in Slovakia. And the guy was not showing up in debates is now our Putin's ass licking prime minister... RIP ROMANIA üíÄ
  97. And he‚Äôs still losing.  ü§¶
  98. He's too busy getting his asshole stretched by other men.
  99. Well, it would be good for some countries if their presidents simply disappeared into thin air
  100. Reminds me of trump avoiding debates depending on who is on the other side.

So given the sad state of the world, he'll probably win.
  101. Is Simion the one who denied being on a gay sex tape, before it was even published?
  102. poot's wire didn't hit
  103. That's just too easy for a populist. By inviting him on TV and giving him the opportunity to refuse and make up every possible deranged conspiracy as a reason you're actually boosting his image.
  104. Rigged social media algorithms are probably much more beneficial to him than televised debates.
  105. That Czech bitches did it, twice.
  106. there‚Äôs a pattern here: italian PM meloni (far right, trump ass licker) has never had a confrontation with journalists or opponents on tv since she was elected. she only publishes ‚Äúupdates‚Äù on her social media often using backgrounds that simulate a conference room, yes that happens
  107. Based on that behaviour, I'm going to assume that he's *very* right wing?

>George-Nicolae Simion is a Romanian politician and civic activist. He is the founder and chairman of the right-wing to far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR)

Ah, what a big surprise...
  108. The guy (Simion) in not exactly equiped for debates. The best thing he can do is to not show up for any.

Or to have some dirt on Nicu»ôor and to speak it in the last one.
  109. Wow, you guys have presidential debates? Must be nice.
  110. Maybe they should broadcast live debate, but when reporter asks a question to Simion, cameraman just pans a camera to the empty chair and plays cricket sound.
  111. Nicu»ôor Dan looking at those eggs like they're not gonna eat themselves
  112. Were they going to have a water balloon fight?
  113. 
Hey /u/PjeterPannos,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
  114. I hope the TV station gave the whole time to Nicurson Dan so he could present his case. Free political advertisement, entirely unopposed, thanks for the opposing coward that can't stand up to scrutiny.
  115. In Hungary, there hasn't been a prime ministerial election debate for 20 years.
  116. How fucking dumb are these people voting for a Putin ally.. its mind boggling.
  117. They've brainwashed their base to be 100% convinced that they wouldn't be able to answer truthfully because "da woke libs".
  119. Why is he not showing to debate?
  120. Idk how anyone can root for a politician that refuses to debate. Not only does it show he is a coward but that's also the very basis of their job.
  121. Does this person exist? Has anyone actually checked?
  122. Brasil in the meme saying ‚Äúfirst time?‚Äù
  123. Is he making more gay porn videos that are definitely fake?
  124. Haha, in his 25 years of being in power, Putin has not even once participated in any debates. This actually helps him keeping his high rating.
  125. He needs to be barred from running at all. We can't let P*tin attack Our Democracy.
  126. They do this because debates are one of the pillars of a democracy. Orban does the same. He never debates and only appears in shows that are run by the government because he knows that a debate could legitimize the opposition as a real alternative to his rule.
  127. Less talk less mistake
  128. Picture taken to maybe look like he's looking at the empty chair but really he's looking at whatever the fuck is going on with that weird bowl of coloured eggs.
  129. He probably have radio shows and social media algorithms working for him. You don't win elections through legacy media appearance nowadays.
  130. Hey it worked for Felon Don
  131. because everything he says is a lie and he doesn't have an answer when confronted
  132. ohm
  133. Romanians should keep in mind what happened with trump in the USA, and vote like their democracy depended on it, because it kind of does
  134. No way!
  135. How can Romanians vote for this person. He is obviously a coward and has no business running a country
  136. Now if stupid people would somehow take the conclusions from this and stopped voting for pro-russian idiots, that would be great.
  137. Actualy the chair is Simion
  138. So this Simion guy is like the Romanian Orb√°n? Orb√°n got beaten up by Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny so hard in a debate before the 2002 elections that he never recovered, never ever agreed to a debate since then.
  139. Can someone please explain the bowl of colourful eggs?
  140. Dude looks like, "I am hungry, I wonder if these eggs have chocolates in them."
  141. I love this image lmao
  142. Un related but whats with the eggies
  143. You don't have to debate if the election is bought by Putin for you. You don't care about democracy anyway.
  144. What a pussy
  145. Well, considering it‚Äôs not even close, why would he?
  146. Whys is there a bowl of water balloons on the table?
  147. Eurojoke
  148. Is Romania even a democracy anymore?
  149. Which one is the pro-Russian traitor?
  150. Update: The national tv channel invited both of them for a confrontation Today. George Simion announced that Nicu»ôor Dan can come today but that he will come tomorrow and debate by himself.
  151. Are we actual sure he exists?
  152. Replace him with a tub of lard.
  153. Def thought that was dirt on my phone under the S.
  154. Oh look, same pathetic coward like daddy Putin.
  155. feels there is no need for televised debates when victory is promised and organized for him
  156. It worked for Trump in the US after his failure against Kamala was televised he just never did it again
  157. And yet the polls are tied.
  158. It's the same strategy Donald used. 

If it works it ain't stupid, but it shows how his voters think.
  159. I‚Äôd like to welcome y‚Äôall to the Nicusor Show
  160. Is Simion a coward?
  161. He will still get votes however!
  162. I have no idea about any of this but he looks so lonely. He's looking so longingly at the empty chair.
  163. Is SIMION THAT RUSSIAN CUNT
  164. More eggs for me.
  165. And still, after all of this, 45% of the country still voted for him. Unbelievable. He has showed his true face in these last two weeks but people are blind.
  166. Understandable, He probabably needs a russian prompter to answer any question. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

=== POST #26 ===
**Title:** UK Citizens Supports Rejoining the European Union
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 25438
**Comments (135):**
  1. Polling in the UK is in a really weird place right now. You have results like this, but then you see polls placing Reform in the lead (or matching) the other party‚Äôs‚Ä¶
  2. I think important decisions like this should need a 2/3 majority. Otherwise they're going to want to get out again in a decade.
  3. I can't see any path to the UK actually rejoining though, like between territorial disputes, fishing disputes etc someone would veto it surely
  4. Without seeing the sample size, locations etc surveys like this mean almost nothing. The surveys pre brexit showed the same.
  5. That support would plummet into the abyss if you told them they'd need to accept concessions like free movement or adopting Euro.
  6. Lol, always a pointless exercise as long as you ask the question absent any context:

Q. "Would you like more things?"

A. "Yay!"

Versus:

Q. "Would you like to rejoin the EU if it also means; no opt-outs from the euro/schenghen/eurojust/bailout-mechanisms. You also get freedom of movement and the promise of ever-closer-union in terms of supranational political integration? Oh, and the rebate is gone baby."

A. "...Erghh!"
  7. I never understood why this topic keeps resurfacing. According to the same pollster Brexit isn't even in the top 10 of voters priorities:
 https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/trackers/the-most-important-issues-facing-the-country
  8. While I very much support this, the issue with these polls is that the public will assume the terms are to resume the UK‚Äôs membership as it was, veto, exemptions from euro and Schengen, rebate, the lot, whereas I do not see the EU being prepared to even entertain any kind of preferential offer. 

I would much prefer to see the pollsters ask a second question: ‚Äûwould you like to rejoin the EU if it meant adopting the euro and joining Schengen?‚Äú

This is the situation I am curious about!
  9. Aren‚Äôt you tired of reading the same news again and again and again?
  10. I'm dreading the worst timeline, where we have a repeat of Brexit just backwards.

We have a referendum on rejoining *(There will be "The EU will send us ¬£350 million a week" painted on the buses)*, it passes and we agree to rejoin Europe, than then our government absolutely fumbles the agreement to rejoin, we lose nearly everything, ¬£ included, and would actually be worse off back in.... and then the government forces the terrible deal through with no second question on if we want to rejoin under these terms or not because we voted in some unbinding referendum on a rough idea of what might happen 4 years ago. 


And worst of all...the French will get the Fish!
  11. I think being cooperative but separate partners is best for both. Britain was never keen on integration, we had a very different idea of what the EU should be. Now the EU can crack on with integration
  12. 52-48 was too small a majority for such a large decision. It should've never gone ahead in the first place
  13. Let's trade Slovakia and Hungary membership for the UK
  14. When YouGov does these polls, does it ask respondents if they understand what UK would have to accept if they join the EU. I doubt if that % would be 55% if they knew...
  15. I think that approval would decrease significantly if it were made clear to respondents that re-entry would probably be linked to significantly worse conditions/concessions compared to the exceptions at the time.
  16. I was too young to vote. A lot of people my age would have voted to stay üíó
  17. Spain won't let them join and they would have to adopt the Euro. I don't think it will happen anytime soon.
  18. It's no. We can do without it. Tired of having to deal with a people who only think of themselves.
  19. I don't mind getting the UK back in the EU. But it have to be like a 2/3rd majority voting in UK, don't want all this in and out again.
  20. I doubt Britain would adopt euro
  21. I love the Brits. And i would be happy to see them back.
  22. And what's the level of support amongst EU citizens for allowing the UK to rejoin?
  23. I'll be honest, as a Briton, we shouldn't touch this.

Brexit is poison. I voted remain and for Labour but forcing this 'debate' amongst the electorate, again, would do nothing but pour more fuel on the Reform fire. The people are fucking tired of it. We should seek to build closer, working relationship with our allies in Europe, particularly in defence and in removing barriers for trade, but as far as getting embroiled in EU political shenanigans, we should avoid it with a 12ft pole. It will only cause turmoil for the UK and the EU.
  24. European Union is the only future of our countries.
  25. Rejoining the EU? We‚Äôd be the laughing stock of Europe. 
People should‚Äôve used their brains when they voted.
  26. At least I would be allowed to vote on this one, still pissed that I was too young to vote on the first referendum
  27. They had such a great position in the EU before brexit. People are so fkn stupid
  28. Lol polls with majority support for Brexit 12h after they rejoin
  29. Too late, uk will not rejoin eu for a very long time, those who voted to leave should take their moment and realise they were mega gullable.
  30. BRENTER
  31. Brejoin?
  32. Brentry?
  33. They should stay where they are if they fight the EU every step of the way, like before!
  34. I wouldn't trust this. 

Where was the poll conducted? It could be on an eu site which if so would get a biased count of pro-eu British.
  35. Ain't gonna happen.
  36. I guess we need to install a revolving door then
  37. When it comes down to an actual vote you know only the nay sayers are gonna show up anyway lol.
  38. Why does it take more to do the right thing and less to do the wrong thing?¬†


Like this result is the same but flipped in the original Brexit referendum. But no politicians are crying from the rooftops saying we gotta join the EU. The people have spoken!!
  39. Ask them if they want to join if it means on the same premises as everybody else. They want special deal. No thanks.
  40. Us Brits wanting to rejoin the EU...

"But look, here comes Russian Farage with the Immigration Chair"
  41. I suspect support from rejoining the EU may dive sharply when the UK discovers that they're required to use the Euro and kiss the pound sterling goodbye...
  42. The problem of rejoining is the government.  It needs to be fully committed. If labour loses the next election and tories win they'd likely try and change terms.
  43. No they don't. Misinformation at it's finest
  44. They should come back to the EU. We cannot anymore take the eurostar or a ferry to UK, without a passport, which is very annoying
  45. C'mon Keir, do the right thing.
  46. As a non British, i have no clue whatsoever what is going on anymore with UK politics. 

It's a mix of "getting closer to europe" and "getting closer to Trump" at the same time which makes 0 sense.
  47. How am I missing these polls?
  48. Yes, meanwhile Farage is coming back ü§£ü§£ü§£ No ty.
  49. From the pragmatic point of view, what's wrong with rejoin/rebrexit referendums every 10 years? It keeps both extremes, EU bureaucrats and local populists in check.
  50. While I am all for rejoining and think we will in the future, I wouldn't put too much stock in this. 

There isn't the political will to re-join at all with how toxic brexit was, it will be at least another election cycle before any government even thinks about touching it again.

Hopefully by then we will have grown up a bit as a society and be able to let go of the old idea of what Britain used to be but hasn't been for over a century.
  51. Breturn is coming
  52. Not surprised
  53. As long as they don‚Äôt have to go outside for 30 minutes and vote. üó≥Ô∏è
  54. Should replace the UK flag with something more representative of Euro"skeptics". Someone can be a British patriot and pro-EU
  55. I believe YouGov got similar results too
  56. UK posters in the streets for Brejoin. Turkey is not in EU let's go back.
  57. Rather pointless poll really

Although I would support the concept this poll mean nothing as the actual terms of us rejoining are not know 

  
but if you added to the pool that we would have to scrap the Pound and adopt the Euro  - which would almost certainly be the case - then the results would change

and only the Gods know what else would have to change
  58. A number of people during the brexit Vote, those who weren't Pro-Tory or Pro-Reform. Didn't actually go out to vote to remain in the EU. Mostly due to the utter stupidity of the vote, so most non-Tory voters stayed home. 

Me & My father have been very pro-Labour. So the both of us weren't all that happy when we left. 

So, just keep in mind this: Don't always judge a countrys people by right-wing's idiots. During the 14 years of sacking & pillaging during those elections, the only reason why the torys won was because of factionalism, meaning the torys always won was because no one could agree on a political party.

- Random British Person.
  59. Welcome back!
  60. And where was the "Unsure" option way back in 2016? Jeeze.
  61. Come back UK! ü´∂
  62. Yeah, but are they willing to give up the pound sterling for it?
  63. This is such bullshit. Get Europes balls put your mouth. Europe are no better they are tyrants that hate anyone who disturbs the status quo
  64. BRITURN
  65. Well yeah, as a Brit and a remain voter we all know why. Of the 5 major groups that voted Leave 4 of them have felt the consequences.  
  
The old that voted to leave were killed during covid reducing the leave vote.  
The farmers realised that not only do we import Agriculture, we also exported it too borderline tariff free while they reaped EU Subsidies, so not only did they lose the subsidies, they realised they weren't gonna strong arm Supermarkets into paying whatever they wanted.  
The fishermen realised the same as the farmers that leaving the EU restricts the waters they can actively fish in making it harder to get the yield they were prior.  
The inept realised that Nigel Farage wasn't gonna put 350M a week to the NHS like the bus said.

Meaning the 5th group, the rich who wanted to abuse UK Tax laws, and the stupid that think Reform UK and Nigel Farage want to give the NHS a ¬£17BN cash injection are the ones left voting no. Ironically enough, Nigel telling people to leave is the exact reason we can't "Send the boats back to France" like his voter base wants because we're no longer part of the Dublin Agreement.

One of the major terms of Brexit was that if we ever rejoined, we wouldn't be given the same treatment as the first time around and we'd have to drop the ¬£ and adopt the ‚Ç¨, which will be hardest point to sell to the public.
  66. Brits want to rejoin until they learn that rejoining would mean losing the sterling.
  67. Naming it here first......Breturn
  68. Wasn't it essentially like this before, and then broken down by lies leading up to the vote? I think you'd want 65% for rejoining before you even think about putting the country through that again.
  69. I never wanted to leave in the first place. Also, can we have the euro?
  70. With that rate its better they stay where they are.
  71. Not against rejoining, but what a waste. Went from being equal partners to the new guys in the bloc. Surely we will be in a weaker position within the union.

Can't leave and come back without any damage
  72. I wish there would be a compromise. Europe needs to heal and stand together¬†
  73. I think if they really want to come back they should at least be forced to adopt the Euro üòÖ
  74. They should definitely not get any special arrangements like the 1st time
  75. What a surprise. I wouldn't take us back if I were them. We're not to be trusted.
  76. I want to rejoin the EU, but being realistic that support will drop when people realise we won't get the same deal we had before and we need to adopt the Euro etc.

It will need to be up around 65-70% before it's possible.
  77. In the meanwhile they vote Reform, just for entertainment, I suppose, ...
  78. Keep an eye on that 33% of Russians. US showing what happens when it hits 51%.
  79. They are welcome but no special treatment.

Don't think the UK can agree to that sadly
  80. As a teenager or someone in the twenties you were tired of living at home. Always complaining and opposed to everything. You moved out and found out it could be tough on your own. Money wasn‚Äôt as easy to get as you thought. Standing alone not as easy as you thought. And now you want to move back home again?
  81. Didn't Cameron say there was never going to be another vote?

What use is this poll
  82. Nope, no and please no
  83. I miss being in the EU so much. I really think we should get another vote.
  84. An island that's consistently voted for less immigration and elected parties based on that promise since voting for brexit....Yea, I smell shite.
  85. But also Reform is surging? I don't know to what extent it's the electoral system that is mad or just that the British electorate are very confused
  86. Dayummm bro. Brits fucked up by leaving. XD
  87. It was dumb to leave EU on a simple majority, it was 51-49. They should‚Äôve at least set it to 60% minimum.
  88. The UK made its bed with Brexit they can lie in it. They wanted out, they got out. Rejoining won‚Äôt be as easy or on their terms, and the EU isn‚Äôt about to waste time entertaining Brexit 2.0. The door isn‚Äôt locked, but the conditions won‚Äôt be a warm welcome.
  89. Give it ten more years and support for rejoining will be far into the 60-70% range. I believe this will give politicians a lot of cover and enable a more public debate about rejoining. If this does happen hopefully we can find our way back
  90. Come back when the polls show 90% in favor. Everything else is just a waste of everybody's time.
  91. They should have never left.
  92. Guessing this means Boomers are dying off.
  93. Tbh‚Ä¶ this is like America and Trump‚Ä¶ no more than 30% of us ever supported him. We are being led around by the nose by extremists.
  94. üòÇü§£if they want to join they must say goodbye to the pound‚Ä¶ because EU won‚Äôt accept them otherwise
  95. We in the EU do not want you back. You cannot leave the EU and keep all EU benefits. If you are in the EU then stick to the rules and stop being special and particular in your attitudes. You are too arrogant and rude people from my personal experience. We really don't need people like that in the EU. May your aristocracy remain as far away as possible.
  96. And those millions of pounds to NHS would have to go back to Europe/s
  97. We dont want them back anyway.
  98. Wonder why rmtgey want to join a corrupt EU , or the poll is a paid opinion, paid by the globalists
  99. Turns out the majority of the UK Citizens hate democracy. /irony
  100. No, thanks
  101. Only if the stop being such USA sidekicks and start having a european consciense. Else, no, we are just fine separate
  102. It's not the UK citizens, who will make this decision. It will be the EU. If one member vetoes the process, then the UK will not join.
  103. I mean yeah, a lot of old cunts have died in the last decade.
  104. 55% is NOT 2/3, so this shouldn't even be considered. Almost half the people polled are still uninterested, so let's not open this shit-show again.
  105. Meanwhile....the UK political leaders have no problem saying no...and generally ignoring everything EU does or EU says....
  106. In my opinion it is quite dumb and counterproductive to use national flag as symbol of anti-EU sentiment.
  107. If everyone in the UK today voted the same as they did in the 2016 vote, remain would win by landslide because of how many old leavers have died
  108. A good amount of leave voters is dead by now.
  109. As a EU citizen I think there should be at least a 2/3 majority in the UK for rejoining before we start talking about it
  110. UK would have left and rejoined before Turkey is even considered.
  111. Europe is not a door, you can't re enter as you wish, if you want to join adopt the euro
  113. I wouldn‚Äôt let them back in until 66% of them are in favour of rejoining.
  114. I‚Äôm always surprised by polls like this. I don‚Äôt ever think about Brexit anymore and it no longer really comes up in conversations like it used to. I think we have more or less moved on from it, irrespective of how we voted individually. I was a remain voter but the sting of Brexit has gone now. I think reopening this chapter would do us more damage than just accepting it for what it is and forging ahead in a different way with the EU.
  115. If it was my choice I'd rejoin the EU, ditch the pound, fully implement Schengen, finish implementing metric and drive on the right.

But then I'd also reform the EU into an actual country in its own right, strip out a lot of the bureaucracy, make its own army and demote current national heads of government to essentially becoming governors over their territory - essentially forming the world's newest superpower.

I feel like I'm *probably* an outlier though.
  116. And i am sure the EU polls in favor ok UK rejoining! About time we corrected this mistake and present a united and strengthened European front against all the problems we're currently facing. 

UK is by all measures and means an integral part of any foreseeable form of the European Union. Or at least it should be.
  117. Full adoptation of the metric system and driving on the right.
  118. As always, people will be light years ahead of the politicians.

Everything that is happening, from free movement, to cultural exchange, to trade, to defence, makes clear that the UK should be in the EU
  119. Maybe on a one in, one out basis. Replace Hungary with the UK
  120. Come on UK! You can do it!
  121. Brexit was always incredibly age-weighted. Some of this is those old people dying.
  122. The euro is not an insurmountable obstacle to Britain rejoining. An important point to remember: new EU members have to *commit* to joining the euro but that‚Äôs not the same as *actually* joining it. 

Poland joined the EU 21 years ago along with 9 other countries that had to commit to join the euro. In reality, Poland has kept its own currency, has no concrete plans to join the euro, it‚Äôs not a live subject either in political discourse or amongst the populace, and the EU isn‚Äôt raising it either
  123. Okay, now ask the EU if it thinks UK should rejoin...
  124. We want you back uk cousins
  125. Nah, now you stay like that.
  126. as if it was a bad idea to leave the EU xD
  127. Whats the point of wanting to have the UK so bad back in the EU? They made cristal clear that they are an untrusthy ally to the union.

We don't need prima donnas when we have a lot of potential inside the EU, specially since UK is on a declining projection,
  128. Please let us back in
  129. Well of course, a lot of the old farts that voted to leave have shuffled off this mortal coil leaving the people who've had to live with this mess for the past 10 years.
  130. UK needs to rejoin the EU
  131. I fuck hate the state the uk is right now it hurts my soul that its only 55 what has brexit got us¬†
  132. I think a large part of this is down to Gen Z (my generation) entering the electorate in force now. In 2016 we couldn‚Äôt chose but I remember from my government and poltics A-Level a load of articles and news stories showing how if older/ more politically savvy gen Z (16-18 year olds at the time) could vote, the UK wouldn‚Äôt leave the EU. Now that we can vote and our voice matters it places the UK back into the narrow pro-EU stance. 

Plus its just kind of been shit.
  133. We acted like spoilt toddlers, stormed out of the room, and slammed the door. Now, after a few years outside in the cold, clearly hungry for the comforts we gave up, we want to re-enter. After all that noise and mess, who would want us?
  134. They don‚Äôt seem to understand it‚Äôs a done deal, rejoining would mean renegotiating again and they will never get a deal as good as they had. It will never be the way it was.
  135. 1/3 of the UK being stubborn twits.

**Title:** EU Council to discuss removal of Hungary's voting rights in the European Union on May 27
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 25303
**Comments (139):**
  1. Good. Thats money not for hungarians, thats for Orban and family.
  2. Some quotes from the underlying process and issues *(*[*source*](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-12266-2018-INIT/en/pdf)*)*:

Elections

*'The campaign was animated but hostile and intimidating campaign rhetoric limited space for substantive debate and diminished voters‚Äô ability to make an informed choice. Public campaign funding and expenditure ceilings aimed at securing equal opportunities for all candidates.* ***However, the ability of contestants to compete on an equal basis was significantly compromised by the government‚Äôs excessive spending on public information advertisements that amplified the ruling coalition‚Äôs campaign message. With no reporting requirements until after the elections, voters were effectively deprived of information on campaign financing, key to making an informed choice****. It also expressed concerns about the delineation of single-member constituencies.'*

Corruption and conflicts of interest

*'Hungary benefits from Union funding amounting to 4,4 % of its GDP or more than half of public investment.* ***The share of contracts awarded after public procurement procedures that received only a single bid remains high at 36 % in 2016.*** *Hungary has the highest percentage in the Union of financial recommendations from OLAF regarding the Structural Funds and Agriculture for the 2013-2017 period. In 2016, OLAF concluded an investigation into a EUR 1,7 billion transport project in Hungary, in which several international specialist construction firms were the main players. The investigation revealed very serious irregularities as well as possible fraud and corruption in the execution of the project. In 2017, OLAF found ‚Äúserious irregularities‚Äù and ‚Äúconflicts of interest‚Äù during its investigation into 35 street-lightning contracts granted to the company at the time controlled by the Hungarian Prime-Minister‚Äôs son-in-law. OLAF sent its final report with financial recommendations to the Commission‚Äôs Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy to recover EUR 43,7 million and judicial recommendations to the General Prosecutor of Hungary.* ***A cross-border investigation, concluded by OLAF in 2017, involved allegations related to the potential misuse of Union funds in 31 Research and Development projects****.'*

Privacy and data protection

*'In the concluding observations of 5 April 2018, the UN Human Rights Committee expressed concerns that Hungary‚Äôs legal framework on secret surveillance for national security purposes allo****ws for mass interception of communications and contains insufficient safeguards against arbitrary interference with the right to privacy.****'*
  3. Frankly, I am astonished that the Europeans have tolerated Hungary for a having a pro Russian autocrat that leeches from the European Union for as long as they did.
  4. "Ministers will hold the eight hearing of Hungary as part of the Article 7 procedure triggered by the European Parliament‚Äôs reasoned proposal of September 2018."

2018 !!!

That was almost 7 years ago! With this efficiency, I think the EU should start preparing an agenda to how to leave the solar system to get prepared for the event when the Sun will explode at the end of her life, a couple of billion years later from today.
  5. Might be an unpopular opinion but if there is an issue with 1 country blocking the wishes of the all the other member states by the way they vote, then surely some sort of reform on the voting process would be better than  removing the voting rights of people that are not voting in the direction you want?

The EU mentioned this being a potential issue way back in 2009 when Serbia applied to join the EU and said reform was needed before they could ascend, but nothing ever happened. Resorting to undermining a democratic process because those at the top are unable or unwilling to reform the system should have alarm bells ringing for most people in the EU.
  6. As a hungarian, i say finally. I never voted for Orb√°n or fidesz in my life. Something was always felt a bit off from him, but he is more and more open on where he stands.  My only hope now is 26' election. I dont care if I have to vote on satan himself, i just want to see Orb√°n lose.
  7. Nice! Give them a last chance to remove Orban, though.
  8. Just f‚Äôing do it.
  9. To be fair it's a goal of Russians to create this divide. Pro-Russia Hungarians will have another argument to exit the EU (and be puppet state of Russia).
  10. Better late than never. Took long enough.
  11. About time. Hungary has been blocking EU sanctions, vetoing aid packages, and generally acting like they're not part of the union while still taking billions in EU funding. Orb√°n can't have it both ways.

Article 7 procedures exist for a reason - when a member state consistently undermines EU values and democratic principles, there have to be consequences. Hungary's been skating by for years while eroding press freedom and judicial independence.

This won't pass easily though. Need unanimous support minus Hungary, and countries like Poland might still back them despite their own issues with the EU.
  12. Tomorrow, which other member will be disenfranchised?
  13. Slovakia will probably veto.
  14. Democracy
  15. I dont think the vote right should be removed but the Veto one should definetly.
  16. YES, PLEEEAAASE!!!!
  17. Fico will veto that in 3, 2, 1...
It's depressing that EU and US leaders were sleeping at the wheel regarding Russia since 2014.
  18. this has no sense. Maybe it would be better to create a mechanism to kick countries out of the union. But if they are members they should have the same rights thay any other member has
  19. Yeah, that wont feed anti-EU sentiment at all.
  20. Take away the voting rifghts of people who disagree with you, that sure is a way to guarantee all agree with you.
  21. Hmm Slovakia with Fico might try to veto no?
  22. Could someone explain to me why do they bother ? Of course I wish this would pass, but Slovakia will vote no and that‚Äôs the end of it. 

Surely the politicians know this so what‚Äôs the point? Just to have it on record that they tried or what am I missing?
  23. Big move. Curious to see how this plays out and what it means for EU unity going forward.
  24. This is a good move
We can‚Äôt have a Trojan horse within Europe 
Orban is a Putin puppet
  25. About fucking time
  26. *Finally*

Hopefully they come to the right decision.
  27. Hopefully Hungarians can vote out this idiotic russian bootlicker in the next election
  28. So much for that "DEMOCRACY" they keep shoving down people's throats. The hypocrite EU
  29. A shining example of European Democracy
  30. That would be nice
  31. this should have happened 2 years ago
  32. Finally, about time¬†
  33. Took long enough.
  34. Can‚Äôt wait üòç
  35. I know it's been going on for a long time, but at least now the average hungarians have the chance to realize without EU funds the state cannot maintain their current spending. Orb√°n and his NER oligarchs steal every last forint, so the people are not seeing anything in return for the insane amount of taxes.

Once the people suffer the economic consequences of this failed system, they will finally lose trust in the current soviet government and they will be more inclined to overthrow them in the 2026 election.

Polls already show that Fidesz-voters are starting to lose trust and many are planning to vote for the opposition party Tisza!

Let's hope Tisza and it's leader P√©ter Magyar survives the pressure.
  36. So in EU as country‚Äôs we have the right to vote as long as we agree with everything and if we disagree they will remove our voting rights? 40years now the teach as that Europe is the center of democracy. In the last years this has changed a lot.  In EU the people need more voting rights. First of all the president needs to be elected by the people and not behind closed doors.
  37. Oh thank fck for that.
  38. Another episode of "The hypocrisy of EU and it's schizophrenia"
  39. About fucking time !!
  40. So was Hungary‚Äôs vote conditional upon them voting with the status quo every single time?
  41. Yes please. Hungary is the reason my views changed from ‚Äûtotal European inclusion‚Äú to ‚Äûthrow out the unwilling‚Äú. Sadly, exclusion of a member state is not intended in the EU contracts.
  42. Good. Do it. Set the precedent for the EU that you cannot hinder pro-EU agendas with your Putin filled ears.
  43. they have been discussing this before. nothing will come to it now as well.
  44. Good! It‚Äôs long overdue! And take every single cent from Putins puppet
  45. The iron curtain needs to come down on Hungary until they get rid of that Putin asslicking son of a bitch.

I've had it with these fascists. Give em what they deserve.
  46. As a Hungarian our only hope is Magyar P√©ter. If he doesn‚Äôt get elected in 26‚Äô I‚Äôm moving to another country.
  47. I support this. Can I vote too ?
  48. It's about time!
  49. Fascinating, really watching so many celebrate the idea of removing a voice while chanting the praises of democracy.  freedom, but only for those who fall in line. And yet, they applaud, certain they stand on higher moral ground. Pathetic.
  50. Hope Slovakia under Fico is next‚Ä¶
  51. Lololol "free democratic"
  52. What grounds need to be satisfied for a member to be stripped of voting rights?
  53. As a Hungarian living abroad, not in that little echo chamber where votes can be bought by giving a 13th month pension, I am happy about this. Although, for the sake of the Hungarians living all around Europe, and the ones who live in Hungary, I hope we are not being kicked out of the EU because of an arse.  
No, most people didn't vote for him because he's a friend of Putin and Trump, The pensioners voted for the extra pension, others voted as the Opposition, former MSZP members, is a constant reminder of the socialist past for the 40+, also many people still remember 2005-2008 when they were in power. So, it's not about Hungarians agreeing with Orban. It's a pick your poison case.

Probably the voting system should be changed to 2/3 majority, instead of veto system
  54. Lmao at all the comments celebrating this, when silencing the opposition is exactly what the regimes you hate do.
  55. go. Enough with the russian assets who sabotage the union.
  56. If you lose voting rights for not voting a particular way, you never had voting rights to start with anyway. The EU is a joke.
  57. Yay to democracy and freedom!

Rest in peace Voltaire with his ‚ÄúI disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.‚Äù

When a country is expressing the opinion that doesn‚Äôt match - they are incovenient, let‚Äôs kick them out.

Well done, the true spirit of The Union ‚≠êÔ∏è
  58. I really hope hungary wont comply with the eu after this. No money, no vote, eu scepticism turns out to be correct afterall
  59. Any EU member that falls below the requirements to join EU should automatically lose their voting rights (at least as far as free and fair elections go).
  60. democracy only if you agree with me
  61. I wholeheartedly support this. Do it, deal the consequences later.
  62. So basically, the EU is saying ‚Äúvote how we want you to vote or we will stop you from voting‚Äù
  63. Thank you EU commissars! You've already pushed direct democracy aside by ignoring referenda so removing voting rights of member states is only the next logical step. Really looking forward to the future that EU nationalists have in store for us.
  64. Fucking finally. I can only dream of that. Once we get rid of dangerous's countries right to vote then we can start to actually reform the UE
  65. Why discuss? Remove it already!!!
  66. Finally!
  67. Finally¬†


Maybe shit can be done then, instead of EU-Hitler vetoing everything
  68. Fucking finally
  69. Very democratic to vote for removal of a nation's right to vote.
  70. Too little, "discuss", too late -- should have happened years ago.
  71. No taxation without representation. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll comply with EU policy even harder now!
  72. Slovakia with Fico is a guaranteed veto sadly, they replaced PiS Poland
  73. Anyone else just get pissed off at this point when you see an article saying some institution is gonna deliberate whether to do something they should have done ages ago but probably still wont do?
  74. Not gonna happen. Unfortunetly.¬†
  75. if a precedence is set then one has to ask where the line is drawn
  76. Correct me if I'm wrong, but even if they manage to remove Hungary's voting rights, isnt there another country doing the same shit? Because i remember for those unanimous votes, it was always Hungary and another country (i forgot which one)
  77. Spoiler: Nothing will happen. Unfortunately.
  78. Maybe a discussion to setup a future discussion on discussing the process of discussing a way to discuss to eventually maybe someday discuss doing something about the discussions that must happen to discuss the removal and to discuss the voting rights of a country that they've had past discussions on and will continue discussing until a time upon which a decision will be made to continue this discussion. Nothing will be done.¬†
  79. They will finally *try*! Mark the day, a Miracle has happened.
  80. Moving at the speed of government on this issue aren't they
  81. Hey
  82. Long overdue
  83.   |
|-||||
  84. I wish the EU had the balls to do it. But it's obvious that nothing will happen.
  85. Mogged
  86. fiiiiinnnally...
  87. Honestly, how likely is it to pass? Wouldn't at least Slovakia veto the resolution? Or is it by qualified majority?
  88. Big move if it happens, Hungary's stance has been testing the EU for a while now.
  89. ### **EU Article 7 Procedure Against Hungary**  

The **EU Article 7 procedure** was initiated against Hungary in **2018** due to concerns over **judicial independence, media freedom, and rule-of-law violations**. The process involves two main steps:  

1. **Determining a "Serious Breach" of EU Values**  
   - Requires **unanimous agreement** from all **other** member states.  
   - **Hungary is excluded** from this vote and **cannot veto the decision**.  
   - If approved, Hungary is officially classified as breaching EU principles.  

2. **Suspending Hungary‚Äôs Voting Rights**  
   - Uses **Qualified Majority Voting (QMV)** instead of requiring **unanimity**.  
   - Approval requires:  
     - **55% of EU countries** (at least **15 out of 27**).  
     - **65% of the EU population** to be represented.  

### **Countries Required to Meet 65% Population Threshold**  
The five largest EU countries **(Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland)** together **exceed 65%** of the total EU population (**66% total**).  

If **Poland opposes the motion**, it needs to be replaced with another **8% of the EU population**. Possible alternative combinations include:  

‚úÖ **Romania (4.2%) + Netherlands (4.0%)** ‚Üí **8.2%**  
‚úÖ **Romania (4.2%) + Belgium (2.6%) + Czechia (2.4%)** ‚Üí **9.2%**  
‚úÖ **Romania (4.2%) + Portugal (2.4%) + Sweden (2.3%)** ‚Üí **8.9%**  

With one of these combinations, the **65% population threshold can still be met**, allowing Hungary‚Äôs **voting rights to be suspended**.

  90. Could Hungary be expelled from the union? Genuine question
  91. Brilliant.
  92. It has been discussed many times before. Call me when it actually happens.
  93. Hungarian here, PLEASE PLEASE IM BEGGING THE EU PLEASE DO IT
  94. Only a couple years late but I'll take it
  95. Based
  96. About time!
  97. About time.
  98. DOITDOITDOITDOITDOIT!!!

Holy hell, how is this even up for  discussion?!

Single veto rights are one of the single biggest mistakes in pretty much every political system that ever included it!
  99. And it will fail, there are always others to protect orban, before it was poland, now it is slovakia.
  100. I'm all in: nothing ever happens
  101. The European Union urgently needs an exit program for members who dishonor the European idea and democracy as a whole! With Hungary, it can only mean HEXIT NOW!!! ‚Ä¶
  102. And in about five years they will do something about it...or not
  103. Good.
  104. I think Trump's new tariff threats are related to this - at partially. The Heritage Foundation - authors of Project 2025 - have [deep ties](https://hrf.org/latest/how-viktor-orban-conquered-the-heritage-foundation/) to Orban and his government. 

If the EU removes Hungary's voting rights, then it will weaken Orban's power, signal to other governments that Rightwing Authoritarianism will not be tolerated, and weaken the Heritage Foundation's influence in the EU.
  105. Is this ‚Äòdiscussion‚Äô simply to placate everyone, or is meaningful, tangible change going to be attempted?
  106. About time...
  107. Very good.
  108. damn they removing voting rights for gru from despicable me
  109. nothing ever happens

they should've done that long ago though
  110. Please
  111. The sooner the EU winds up the better
  112. everyone knows it wont pass anyway.
  113. Yes please, hopefully it will be approved
  114. Wont do sh#t. Europeans are weak.
  115. Ruh ROH... No more Scooby Snacks for Orby, still feel bad for the people trapped there...
  116. finally
  117. Thx God. You listened to my prayer.  Hungarian ancestory here. Dont judge.
  118. Oh 27th May cannot come soon enough!
  119. Europe need to get their shit together and remove whoever is aligned with dictators.
  120. So remove their voting rights, remove the requirements for unanimity, and then reinstate their voting rights. System patched. Unless there are some other countries who would oppose changing the rules‚Ä¶
  121. Let's goooo! üôåüèº
Idiots shouldn't have the power to veto!
  122. Kick them from EU ffs!
  123. God I hope they do that. Orban is a real threat to the EU and Europe as a whole.
  124. i love democracy.
  125. Oh, they're ready to discuss it. I can't wait for them to decide to make a joint statement in 2034.
  126. About time.

And We'll be happy to give it back the moment Orban and his politics will fuck off.
  127. Lmao how fast they flip their rules, what's the point in European UNION if there's no discussion, just plain "no you wrong, screw you Hungary"
  128. This is certainly a long overdue discussion.
  129. Good üëçüèª
  130. Time Hungary were given a choice of act responsibly to enhance the EU or leave. They are no more than a blight on the organisation at the moment.
  131. Let‚Äôs GO!! üôå
  132. Honestly, it‚Äôs about time. EU isn‚Äôt just an economic club. If a member state keeps chipping away at european values and nothing happens, then what‚Äôs the point of having them in the first place? Letting one country do whatever it wants (especially when it comes to undermining courts or limiting press freedom) damages trust between member states. The whole system works because there‚Äôs at least a basic level of shared standards. Article 7 won't solve anything on its own though but keeping the pressure on matters. Will anything come of this? Maybe, maybe not. But at the very least, it keeps the spotlight on what‚Äôs happening and that counts for something.
  133. Good
  134. Yes fucking please
  135. There can be disagreements but outright sabotaging the EU and putting up Russian talking points has no place in the EU.
  136. And all the fascists are celebrating this
  137. Yes, do it please!
  138. I don't think they'll go through with it but we can only hope it happens
  139. About fucking time

**Title:** Russia Returned Ukrainian Journalist Viktoria Roshchyna‚Äôs Body Without Internal Organs
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 23783
**Comments (200):**
  1. Holy shit this is awful. They tortured this poor woman.

>The body showed signs of¬†a¬†postmortem dissection carried out in¬†Russia and presented clear evidence of¬†torture, including abrasions, bruises, a¬†broken rib, and suspected injuries from electric shocks.

>Investigators discovered that several organs were missing, including the brain, both eyeballs, and part of¬†the trachea. According to¬†an¬†international forensic expert consulted by¬†journalists, the absence of¬†these organs could have been intended to¬†obscure evidence of¬†death by¬†strangulation or¬†suffocation
  2. Ghouls
  3. JD Vance calls that propaganda.
  4. The usual routine for those barbarians. Absolutely nothing shocks me about them anymore.
  5. May her soul rest in peace.
  6. Absolutely sickening. Fucking waste of oxygen.
  7. The title gets worse and worse as you read
  8. Honestly, I don't understand what's the point in doing this.

I understand torture to obtain information, but russians seem to basically torture for revenge, for fun. What's the point of the barbarism?

I'll never understand how people can still defend this state. If this is what they're doing to people in the open, I don't want to imagine what they're doing to people in secret, their own citizens that will never make the news bulletin.
  9. Land of tradional values at work. Tormenting one petite woman to death.
  10. Ruzzian scum.
  11. What a barbaric and disgusting country. Any country that sides with them is trash, as well.
  12. They call Ukrainians evil Nazis, but they will happily use their organs
  13. War crimes. Journalists is a no go area.
  14. Russia must lose in a resounding defeat.  America is lost for at least 4 years.  The only way forward is European boots on the ground.
  15. Truly a nation of ‚Äútraditional Christian values‚Äù
  16. In America, we call that mutilation of a corpse.
  17. Putin is such a disgusting, vile monster.  This is just another example.  The best thing we can do is make sure Ukraine is armed with the best weapons we have in the numbers they need.  Putin needs to get pushed out of Ukraine.
  18. This is horrific.¬†
  19. So they poisoned her and knows such things linger in certain organs and can be detected so they remove those organs so they can deny poisoning?
  20. Worse than animals, even animals have more compassion.
  21. Absolutely tragic. Putin and Trump are a disgrace. May her soul rest in peace.
  22. Oh wtf ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
Freaking psychos
  23. Russians are the new Nazis
  24. If you ask Putin, he would blame the Nazi Ukrainians for genetic modifications of Ukrainian overseas agents so that the internal organs wouldn't be needed.
  26. And people still want to negotiate with these animals. I'm tired man.
  27. Destroy Russia, we are beyond peace.
  28. It was a mistake, an oopsie, even. 

- Donald Trump, president of the United States of America
  29. If I said how I felt about this I would be banned.¬†
  30. Animals, the Russian leaders are animals and pure evil. Let us all remember this and not forget who we are dealing with. It‚Äôs not as much the spineless Russian population that is at the center of our anger, it‚Äôs their leaders, their military, the spokespersons that glorify this dark and corrupt regime that needs to be dealt with. 
The sad thing is that the only language monsters understand is an iron fist, ‚ÄúUnited we stand strong‚Äù!
  31. Wow, the state of her body is just... chilling, especially if they removed her organs to hide cause of death and further evidence of torture. Truly tragic and yet another showcase of what kind of monstrosity the russian state is.
  32. I just hope Putin and his type get the same end, only slower.
  33. I‚Äôm sure some MAGATS will come in here to defend this soon
  34. Russia illegally steals organs from civilian non-combatant and innocent Journalist in act of terror - would be a more accurate and fitting title
  35. At this point, Russia doesn‚Äôt give the slightest f*ck about anything. Watching Europeans think they can reason with them is just painful.
  36. Bad putin, right? Removing eyes from journalists in his free time, unlike his ‚Äúforced to be there‚Äù army of animals
  37. Cunts
  38. Poor woman.
  39. This is how Russians have been their whole history. They haven't changed and they never will.
  40. Russians being Russians.
  41. This is likely what Trump is afraid will happen to him.
  42. Is that not a war crime?
  43. Now you know what to do to Putin and his generals.
  44. Looks like that ‚ÄúVladimir, STOP‚Äù Tweet is really working out.
  45. "We wouldn't want anyone to notice the popped blood vessels in her eyes and think we're monsters. Let's gouge them out." 

In all honesty, this seems more probably a calculated act of psychologically warfare. How monstrous. RIP to this woman.
  46. Putin deserves the Mussolini treatment
  47. I'm sick and tired of Russia, they cannot be allowed to exist as a nation no more.
  48. Fucking monsters...
  49. Russia should never be let to exist as it is now after these event. Just the way nazi Germany could not be let to exist. Such horrors.
  50. How the fuck is Russia not taken care of on the international stage? What an absolute joke of a nation. 

Openly showcasing this horrible treatment like it's nothing. Fuck that entire administration and everyone who enables it.
  51. What a fucking sloughterhouse
  52. These are the evil cretins my country‚Äôs leaders are chums with.
  53. MAGA Approved
  54. This is who Trump admires. What a sick nation.
  55. Savages
  56. They're being the most evil possible on purpose. They need to be disposed of.
  57. I wish everything worst on that garbage hellhole of a shitbag country that R*ssia.
  58. This is the regime that Trump is aiding. Shame on anyone who isn‚Äôt supporting Ukraine.
  59. Barbaric filth. Russia in its current form is a blight on this world.
  60. War crime #363245.

The kremlin will pay.
  61. Obscure evidence? No, this is how they tortured the poor woman. There were cases like this in Bosnia in 1990s, Serbs killing their prisoners in awful ways. The motivator is hate.
  62. As expected from Russia.
  63. Your new ally USA üá∫üá∏
  64. Jesus fucking christ, her organs are probably sold on the Russian black market... And people still have the gall to defend them
  65. You know WHO ELSE forcibly harvests people's organs?

MY SUPREME LEADER XI JINPING!
  66. Me reading this: Russia Returned Ukranien Journalist. (Nice) Without internal Organs (Shit)
  67. The fact that she might have been aware when they were doing it is giving me chills. And america is supporting this, is also something i have a hard time believing. This new reality is not what i expected.
  68. Jesus Christ!!!!!!!
  69. Why are they even bothering by hiding the evidence? Couldn't they just say to whatever is discovered that it is just 'Western/Nazi propaganda'?
  70. Classic Russian thing to do
  71. Horrific. Evil beyond all comprehension.
  72. Russia is a terrorist state.¬†
  73. Add that to the kilometers long list of horrific war crimes.
  74. The Reports are horrifying to say the least, at first the body couldn't be recognized, only after DNA testing could they identify her corpse which was missing her brain, eyeballs etc. they presume she was beaten and electrocuted at least. I guess this happens in war with authoritative countries.
  75. What they said about Orc soldiers in WW2 remains true then till this day. Sad. They haven't changed, don't think they will.
  76. Russia needs to be held accountable and not just Putin. This one country has destabilized the entire world. The world needs to slap back.
  77. That is the most depraved shit I have ever heard of.
  78. No one can convince me that there is a single civilized russian left.
  79. Yeah, and people expect/want Ukraine to surrender to these people?
  80. Wow, I don‚Äôt see how this isn‚Äôt a call for total war on Russia
  81. 28 - The number of journalists killed by Russian military and agents since this part of the war started. 10 of them weren't even at work. They were targeted by shelling.

This woman was only 26 years old and was tortured because of propaganda that has been going on since before she was even born.
  82. This single act alone is grounds for war
  83. Y'all in Europe need to push your leaders to arm Ukraine to the teeth. As an American under Trump, I can't do much other than vote against his traitorous party, but I still urge my Congressman to support Ukraine.
  84. But remember, Zelensky and Ukraine are the bad guys and Russia can be realized with. *Sarcasm*
  85. Don't forget your pro-Russian compatriots. They are part of the problem and responsible.
  86. Russia is the enemy.
  87. Is Europe ever going to ever do anything about any of this or just twiddle our thumbs?
  88. These russians that the felon krasnov and elonia admire so much are ghouls.
  89. This is "Russia Today". A terror state, nuclear armed.
  90. If given the choice, I would rather sit in a room with a murderer over a cannibal.

Russia is a cannibal.
  91. What. The. Fuck.

Absolutely diabolical. Disgusting.
  92. *"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men \[and women\] to do nothing."* \- Alexei Navalny.

The Kremlin killed this poor woman for revealing the truth about their false narrative. Yet Moscow's truth is that Ukrainians are crack-addict neo-Nazis corrupted by Polish influence, and that Germans are begging for Barbarossa 2.0 with the cooperation of ultraleftist, transgender, and LGBTQ+ Europeans. They really expect us to believe that?

As long as we live with this current form of the Russian government, there is no justice for those who lost their lives in this terrible war. How could a human do this to another human on purpose?
  93. The end of this war will never be enough. Putin, his generals, and his soldiers must be held accountable. There must be war crimes tribunals and punishment must be severe. I think the Nuremberg trials and punishments should be the guide, using modern investigative techniques.
  94. This is what you get, if you trust Russia.
  95. Ok you guys, just continue repeating that this is Putin's war, "simple Russian people has nothing to do with it", keep it that way and look how "Putin" captures Ukraine, torture and kill Ukrainian people
  97. Russia never changes. You just need to hear what Russian women think of their men who die in Ukraine, they are just walking piles of cash for them. Not only wives but mothers too. 

If mothers think that way you know that a society is fucked up. Human life has no value for them.
  98. Pretty dark even by Putin standards.
  99. Fucking animals.
  100. The usual stuff coming from those savages
  101. Ukraine is defending against an invasion if savage degenerates. Glory to the heroes.
  102. That‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt give up on Ukraine. It would be an insult to all the people that died unfairly in this war.
  103. https://forbiddenstories.org/russia-detainees-investigation-viktoriia-roshchyna/

This is the story she died to make. Unfortunately much was lost with her
  104. I don't have the words to describe how I feel right now
  105. For everyone wondering, they do just for fun, we have a lot of stories like this from people, who were unlucky enough to be captured by ruzzians. Tortures, they give them only water from boiled potatoes or buckwheat, r**e and they don't allow them to sit or lay.Meanwhile ruzzian soldiers who were imprisoned in Ukraine have very good treatment with McDonald's and their wives visiting them. Here's link to  [article ](https://texty.org.ua/articles/111196/devjat-misjatsiv-u-rosijskomu-poloni-oleksij-anulja-rozpoviv-jak-zmuchenyj-holodom-yiv-chervjakiv-i-zhyvu-myshu/) about ukrainian champion Oleksij Anulja who came back from that he'll.
  106. But Trump says Russia is good and Ukraine is bad‚Ä¶what a fucking timeline we are in üòñ
  107. Monstrous barbarity. ¬†
  108. Organs keep a record of whatever drugs and chemicals we're used.
  109. Age of monsters is back.  I hope a heroic knight gets the head of the dragon(s).
  110. this beyond heartbreaking I think of her parents and family
  111. They likely gave those organs to russian soldiers too... the world would be better off without russia at this point. Like there is no saving such a failed, evil country anymore...
  112. They sold her organs.  Sick.
  113. Jesus Christ
  114. Russia is an oppressive terror state, death to fascists.
  115. So, another thing the UN can do nothing about.
  116. What a harrowing story. 

Her example seems clearly designed to send a message to all journalists what their fate will be. 

In fairness, if I was a journalist, I‚Äôd be fairly discouraged. 

May she rest in eternal peace üíó
  117. And you want Ukraine to stop fighting them?
  118. Dude that‚Äôs so fucked up. I just don‚Äôt understand how they praise Putin and Kremlin so much. The facts are right before their noses. They only see Putin smiling and being respectful towards other leaders. Of course he is like that. Doesn‚Äôt matter if a psychopath smiles and is nice to you when he dissects women? I‚Äôm baffled.
  119. These awful jerks! Hope they will get what they deserve‚Ä¶.
  120. Putin is worse than a war criminal.
  121. they have a franchise of torture sites in occupied territories called Isolation, truly the worst of KGB practices

in one of the intercepted radio chatter some orcs bragged how they tortured a sniper woman, by shoving a barbwire inside the tube in her genitals and then pulling out the tube

abhorrent human trash

rip, she fought for truth
  122. Pure evil
  123. When we make it through this dark period, and we drag Russia‚Äôs actions out into the light, we‚Äôre going to have to contend with the fact that they are perpetuating some of the most heinous crimes against humanity of our age.
  124. Wow, that is absolutely awful.
  125. Always remember - Trump sees Pootin and Ruzzia has his allies.
  126. Gee I wonder what organs were taken....

"Nazi occupation was better than Russian liberation" - poland
  127. Oh but Im the monster if I say that putler and his lackeys need to be banned from the minecraft server after being strapped into the end rod machine until they despawn without using any euphemisms
  128. It's ok guys, it's just example number 6139 of Russian Warcrimes.  
A strongly worded letter and an European commitee will show them Moscals to not do it again
  129. So, when will we start treating Putin like Osama Bin Laden? I bet we as society have some professionals which we can easily send there and do *it*.
  130. Can anyone explain why Russia is respected on the international stage anymore? The entire country is a parasitic mafia. Why are they still allowed to leave their borders? Why are they allowed to really exist anymore?
  131. Hey Trump supporting republicans, this is normal, right?
  132. When Germans said ¬¥Wir haben es nicht gewu√üt¬¥ that feeble excuse wasn¬¥t accepted.  Why do people keep saying the Russian government is sick while it goes far deeper than that?  Putin is doing the torturing himself.  Other people are guilty as well.
  133. Bolsheviks never change‚Ä¶
  134. This what the likes of terrorist groups (isis, Hamas, taliban) do to their hostages. Russians are pure degenerates
  135. At this point russians aren‚Äôt people to me
  136. Who knows what the organs would tell...
  137. This makes me despise Russia...but do other countries see what Trump does and then automatically hate me for it? I wonder if the citizens of Russia are ok with this behavior, I'm not ok with trump at all, in fact I wish him the worst...but are there good Russians, or do they all want war and violence. The Russians I've spoken to love Putin and think the war is the right move...so idk
  138. Simply monstrous.
  139. ‚ÄúDamn. We should elect someone that wants to reward this behavior‚Äù

-America
  140. Barbari
  141. The more Russia continues this horrible war, the more such inhumane acts of violence will be uncovered. Whether or not Putin is ready to continue the war is debatable (maybe not quite sure but let‚Äôs err on the side of caution). But is Putin ready to deal with his countries reputation being so tainted that it will likely be a very long time until Russia will be anything but that horrible and violent nation? Think about what the Holocaust did for Germany‚Äôs reputation, but they at least made strides to not repeat history (with slightly less success nowadays unfortunately).

What will Russians say about him when they see everyone looking at them with disgust for what their country did? Will their ‚Äúsaviour‚Äù still be seen as that?
  142. What the fuck is wrong with those people. They do shit like this proudly in the open, most contries would be smart enough to hide this kinda shit. Do they want the whole fucking world to hate them?
  143. Well that's very normal.

What the fuck.
  144. My heart breaks for every poor and brave soul the these fucking Russians take from us. The only justice for this would be a total annihilation of the Russian state similar to Nazi Germany.
  145. Immediate thought is that this was to prevent a toxicology report.
  146. The Russians have always been savages
  147. And that is acceptable accordingly with American‚Ä¶ have no words‚Ä¶ just disgust for those that don‚Äôt do anything about this
  148. And Trump wants Ukraine to surrender to Russia? These uncivilized cretins will continue being a threat.

This is true barbarism and must be removed from Europe, we can't have them at our door.
  149. Okey, that just messed up, like they just don't care at this point.
  150. yikes
  151. Jesus‚Ä¶
  152. Putin ate them
  153. What the fuck?
  154. You know. There's something to be said about feeling bad for dead combatants. Not Russian soldiers though, they're genuinely evil. Every day we inch closer to 1,000,000 russian casualties, which means 1,000,000 orcs too dead or wounded to harm others.¬†


The respectable ones already fled Russia.¬†
  155. Add to the list of how Putin should be treated once captured.
  156. Fucking Nazis.
  157. Just orcs being ghoulish like usually¬†
  158. Orcs probably sold her organs to get money for vodka and krokodil.
  159. America's best friends!
  160. Horrible and yet Nothing will happen anyway, no consequences, Russia gets always with whatever they want
  161. Fuck Russia.
  162. Need the organs for wounded russians.
  163. Wow another day witnessing man made horror beyound my imagination
  164. Is it traditional values and russian soul already?
  165. I bet some sort of Dostoyevsky will describe internal guilt struggle of her executor and people will love it. For those still looking for mysterious Russian soul answer is simple like a coffin nail - it is soulless, just dumb to sickening banality of evil
  166. Putin is a fckn psycho.
  167. What is more disturbing is that our current administration supports these animals. Praising the dictator and parlaying with them, even though they are the aggressor.
  168. What the fuck is wrong with them?
  169. Good lord‚Ä¶ this has me lost for words, what the actual fucking shit.. i already hated russia with a passion this is straight up demonic
  170. Jesus Christ
  171. Special place in hell for all those Russian war criminals that she documented and all the others she wasn't able to.
  172. easier to hide poisoning that way
  173. Wait, I thought the aggressors and brutes who started the war was Ukraine? I didn't know people who didn't start wars act barbaric in this type of way. Gee, it's almost like it's the other way around.
  174. How can people be so barbaric?  I don‚Äôt believe that all Russians are barbaric, but their leaders. I still have a hard time believing that it‚Äôs just one guy, Putin that controls everybody.
  175. Russians really are a special breed.
  176. Average Orc behaviour.
  177. Europe is responsible for this, arm Ukraine to the fucking teeth
  178. This made me spit out my drink. This is a special kind of evil.
  179. SA?
  180. \>United24 (Ukrainian: –Ñ–¥–∏–Ω—ñ24, romanized: Yedyni24)¬†*is a Ukrainian government-run platform*
  181. Nuke the Kremlin asap, PLEASE. This shit can't keep going.
  182. And yet they wanna hate on us. Propaganda and war is getting old
  183. Horrible
  184. This is so fu*ked!! RIP Viktoria
  185. Monsters
  186. Monsters!
  187. ‚ÄòVladimir, STOP‚Äô ü§Æ
  188. So they harvested her organs? What the fuck?
  189. Inhumane..
  190. Orcs
  191. She was no doubt alive when they started taking them.
  192. They are fk-in animals. Actually, animals are better.
  193. Steve Witkoff in the Kremlin beaming from ear to ear shaking that cunt Putins hand. What a pair of vile individuals
  194. Fuck Putin.
  195. You don't think they're trying to sell the organs?
  196. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  197. I read recently about [Lavrentiy Beria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavrentiy_Beria) and the same technique the Russians used On 26 December 1936, Beria summoned the head of the communist party of Abkhazia, Nestor Lakoba, to the Party headquarters in Tbilisi. Beria had Lakoba over for dinner the next day, where he was served fried trout, a favorite of Lakoba's and a glass of poisoned wine when his body was returned to Sukhumi, though notably all the internal organs (which could have helped identify the cause of death) were removed.
  198. What
  199. Orks don't have any humanity in them whatsoever. Dunno why we treat them like they do. Rest easy, hero. Your sacrifice should not be in vain.
  200. Trump both defends and supports these people. And the citizens of the unstable states of america don't do shit about it.

**Title:** Donald Trump Mocks Europe for Celebrating the End of WWII, Says U.S. Won the War
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 23611
**Comments (200):**
  1. We won the war ! 

>Check Donald bio.
 
Dodge the draft. 

Checks out.
  2. Every day Trump can‚Äôt help but remind the world what a piece of shit he is
  3. As an Italian I'm very grateful to all the US citizens that directly and indirectly made the liberation of my country possible in WW2.

I honestly don't feel I should owe *any* gratitude to their children, grandchildren and grand-grandchildren that use their parents, grandparents or grand-grandparents deeds and sacrifices in some kind of political dick measuring contest.

Guess what Joe Nobody from Texas: you didn't won anything, liberated no one. Your grandad did. Your grandma did tons of sacrifices to help the war effort. You were born in th 70s, 80s or 90s and you did fuck all for Europe.¬†We don't owe *you* anything. We owe *your grandparents* our freedom.
  4. He also thinks soldiers are suckers and losers, especially if they get injured or die, so it all tracks. If you hog all the glory and twist history to suit your ego, you're the best. If you actually fight... Sucks to be you.
  5. Like a senile old grandparent ~ there‚Äôs no point arguing with him really. Just leave him to it. Tells a lot about Americans that this is the fella represent them best.
  6. Hey without my country there wouldn't even be a WW2, so be thankful!!!
  7. How could they elect someone so vile and stupid?¬†
  8. Don‚Äôt feed the troll people‚Ä¶
  9. President r/ShitAmericansSay 

>However, Trump made it clear that the new holidays would be ‚Äúworking holidays," and would not include official time off. "We have a lot of holidays, I'm not so sure we should have them, and you don't have to go to work. Our country has to go to work. So we're going to have a working holiday for each one of those two dates," he clarified. 

LMAO.
  10. Trump can say all it wants, but WW2 was a collective effort. UK fought alone for over a year, US provided allies with vital aid and participated in important battles, Soviet Union did seemingly impossible - broke German army's back on the land and took Berlin. Not to mentioned a lot of other nations contributing in one or other way
  11. This is the statement at which adults roll their eyes as they quietly try to minimize the damage from the manchild.
  12. US, the country that wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for France.
  13. Hate Russia all you want, but the historical fact remains that the Soviet Union caused an estimated 80% of Nazi deaths in WW2. That the US gets so much recognition pretty much comes down to soft power and the cultural influence of Hollywood.
  14. Attempting to rewrite history üòíüòí
  15. Giving me [Simpson‚Äôs vibes](https://youtu.be/j-aw4yfVZNg?si=W9YRC5aN7br6QOo9)
  16. There's too many people that want all the glory. 

WW2 was a team effort and each country did their part which led to victory. 

If any 1 event went a different way, the outcome could be different. The UK was a real last stand in europe, most UK leaders wanted to surrender, thank god for churchill, and the codebreakers, alan turing solving enigma.

Thanks to all the french resistance fighters who carried on fighting and spying for the allies after everyone surrendered. 

Thanks to all the russian sacrifice who gave hitler his first real taste at defeat on land. 

It goes on and on, i mean if you want to hear something NEGATIVE about the US, is that they didn't want to get involved until japan made the biggest boo boo ever, so thanks to japan for attacking america and getting them to join in on the action. I mean american help wasn't free either, in the UK we only managed to pay off the US in 2006.

Overall we just all be thankful it went to the way it did, it could've been worse.

As for donald trump mocking europe for celebrating the end of ww2, well....70 million people died, only 500,000 of those were american, you tell me which continent has a bigger right to celebrate their people not dying anymore?
  17. I mean, it's a very common bit of nonsense Americans throw out...

"Wo won World War 2!".

The US veterans who fought alongside the Allies(cant be many of them left at this stsge) must be fucking disgusted to see the rise of fascism on their own turf.

I can't imagine what a slap in the face thst must be. See the cycle repeat.
  18. You know what hilarious? Many scientists who were involved in designing the first atomic bomb were immigrants. In fact - many of the most important contributors to the ‚ÄúManhattan Project‚Äù, the U.S. secret program that built the bomb, were EUROPEAN BORN IMMIGRANTS including indirectly Einstein who was German. AMERICANS WOULD BE NOWHERE WITHOUT IMMIGRANTS.
  19. Donal Trump might study a bit of history to learn about "Stalingrad", "Kursk", "Operation Bagration" and "the Battle for Berlin."

he's such a moron.
  20. 80 years from now we will still be mocking the USA for electing Trump those two times.
  21. This is such a moronic conversation to have about dead heroes worldwide. Everyone who was there fought their asses off and did whatever needed to be done to stop the spread of fascism. They would all be rolling in their graves today no matter what uniform they were once wearing.
  22. Bros acting like they mobilised 30 million troops or willingly fought on the front lines
  24. 8647
  25. US didn't win shit
  26. The correct headline would have been ‚Äûsenile president spouts deranged nonsense about ww2‚Äú.
  27. Lets be honest, this guy is egoistic toxic moron. 

Nothing more, nothing less. 

Shame, where US ended up. But they probably deserve him.
  28. What is he talking about? Everyone knows Canada won WW2.
  29. Weak men create hard times
  30. Dude is on a speed run to piss off everyone.
  31. As an American, I am SO SORRY. 

We're not all like this, I swear.
  32. But for the Japanese the USA wouldn‚Äôt have entered the war. 

As for the First World War, the US gave the world Spanish Flu.
  33. France laughs at Independence Day as the USA didn‚Äôt gain independence against Britain - it was France. France creates a ‚Äúhelp the poor Americans day‚Äù on 4th of July.
  34. This is basically the end of USA/european relations and alliances. 


It is time for Europe to move on and realize that the USA is not needed militarily, economically, or culturally.
  35. Yeah, little emperor and his stutterings - who cares.
  36. You heard the mango everyone.


The next major war Uncle Sam (inevitably) gets himself into, he's completely on his own.
  37. The celebrations we're going to have when he's no longer with us are going to be huge.
  38. History will certainly view him as America's most ignorant, treasonous and corrupt president ever.
  39. Errr, excuse me. The Battle of Britain and Stalingrad for starters.
  40. Trump's opinion holds as much water as his diapers.
  41. Trump's comments are so dumb you don't even know where to even start with explaining how dumb they are... Truly a idiot criminal.

On the other hand this is probably just to take the attention away from any of his recent crimes like accepting the bribe from saudi arabia.
  42. Trump has made the world hate Americans so much.
  43. Haven't they got rid of that twat yet?
  44. The ONLY reason the US faired as well as it did was because it wasn‚Äôt fought on it‚Äôs own territory. One bombing doesn‚Äôt count.
  45. Coming from a man whose closest contact with a history book might have been to stand on it while attempting to look into a women‚Äôs bathroom  window.
  46. The USSR won the war, clearly. An almost pyrrhic victory due to the death toll it cost them, an entire generation of young people wiped out, but it's clear that they contributed far more than the US did.

Honestly I'm sick and tired of the US Military Entertainment Complex churning out pro US WW2 films with the narrative that the US came in and steam rolled their way to Berlin.
  47. I never dreamed of saying it... but maybe Biden was better
  48. Stolen valour on a national scale.
  49. The Allies won WW2. The US lead the fight against Japan during WW2, culminating in victories at Midway, Iwo Jima, and ultimately Hiroshima/Nagasaki. It‚Äôs amazing how many Americans think like Drumpf.
  50. Pls be dementia talking because wtf
  51. The allies including the USSR (who sustained the most losses) won the war.
  52. Turned up after Japan invaded Pearl Harbor, after declining many requests from The Great Winston Churchill. Probably ended WW 2 earlier if they had joined when asked. Then Europe helped with the Pacific war until they dropped the bomb. 

The guy is delusional but we all know that.
  53. Trump has made it almost impossible for me to step outside America without feeling intense shame and embarrassment.
  54. Says Captain Bonespurs ü§°
  55. He even claimed the US won ww1. Holy shit that is stupid. The US arrived just in the end. The french and the British,  but mostly the french, did the heavy lifting that war.
  56. I remember him saying in an interview during D Day celebrations that he basically admired Hitler because he cut through Europe like cheese.
  57. Yes, the US produced a lot of military equipment, munitions and invented the atomic bomb and participated in the campaigns in Pacific and Europe.
But: 

*It was a collective effort involving multiple nations*

In number of deaths the UK lost 383,700 soldiers and 67,000 civilians. The US lost 416,800 soldiers and 1,700 civilians.

China lost 3 million soldiers.
The Soviet Union lost 26-27 million people altogether (8-11 million soldiers). 
France lost 212,000 military personnel (including soldiers conscripted into the Wehrmacht). Poland lost 240,000 soldiers. Unbelievable how many people died..
  58. Europe "helped"?? What the fuck.

How is this man alive holy shit.
  59. Europe ended slavery in US and won the civil war.
  60. The Russians might want a word with him. Winning the war was an ALLIED effort.
  61. Without Britain they would have never won the war, Britain took way more damage than the us did in both world wars
  62. God dammit, fuck you. 

My Grandfathers went to sign up the day Canada declared war on Germany, one of them was refused because he was a steel worker in Hamilton, Ontario.  The other was a dock worker and spent the war in Halifax sending ship after ship of young men fighting for freedom, tanks, bullets, guns, and other things my other grandfather helped make with his steel.

We fought for YEARS before the profiteers in the US realized one side was never going to be able to pay back the loans and finally got in the side of freedom.

This shit is too much for me.  Americans need to wake the fuck up now.  

Damage is already done, this is moving towards irreparable damage now.  

GET OFF YOUR ASSES.
  63. Whatever you say, Bone Spurs.
  64. Why no comment when Putin and Xi celebrated WW2 then???
  65. No problem, we mock him every day
  66. By the same logic, the French won the American War of Independence
  67. The real turd in the punch bowl is the US of IDIOTS
  68. He likes to rewrite history.
  69. Ah, Trump, never in combat, hates people who have been captured by the enemy, considers veterans "losers" and those who serve "suckers." Yet in his cult's mind, he is Rambo, virile, macho, sans pareil. Qualified to judge whole nationa and to provide vacuous and false historical narratives to back up his ridiculous pronouncements while preening for the camera. Could someone please take away his keys?
  70. If I could use a gif right now, I would have picked a facepalm one.

Also r/ShitAmericansSay
  71. If I also recall correctly, the US would not directly get involved in the war until bombs started dropping on their territory. Until that point they were too morally shitstained to put boots on the ground. Meanwhile, Britain, against all odds stood its ground against an overwhelmingly powerful foe. 

So yeah, beat your drum all you want but the real heroes are the countries that had everything to lose and still fought on.
  72. I think the 20 million Russians that died might have something to say about that.
  73. "Well if it weren't for us....you'd be speaking German" 

"No. if it was not for you, i might be dead. But i would still be speaking French" 

Neat little bit of dialogue from The Monuments Men film
  74. listen, it was a joint effort, but 80% of nazis did die on the eastern front. where do americans get this idea that they singlehandedly defeated hitler from?
  75. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  76. Yes and the americans are basically europeans when we consider they are all immigrants. So Europe won the war after all
  77. **"We're the ones that won the war," the president insisted while addressing U.S. troops in Qatar**

# NEED TO KNOW

* Donald Trump recently mocked France and other countries over World War II victory celebrations
* While addressing U.S. troops in Qatar, the president said that it was the U.S. that "won the war"
* Trump then mocked Emmanuel Macron by impersonating a phone call he had the French Prime Minister

President¬†[Donald Trump](https://people.com/tag/donald-trump/)¬†is continuing his campaign to claim victory in World War II for the United States alone.

While¬†[addressing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn7-eCpY3Lk)¬†U.S. troops at Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday, May 15, Trump, 78, spoke about¬†[his recent executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/vcitory-day-for-world-war-ii-2025/)¬†declaring that May 8 is now a national holiday: Victory Day for World War II.

The decision, Trump said, was inspired by seeing other countries celebrate the end of the war in Europe on May 8, also known as¬†[VE Day](https://people.com/prince-george-princess-charlotte-prince-louis-join-kate-middleton-prince-william-ve-day-outing-11726745).

"I'd call up a certain country and they said, ‚ÄòOh, we're celebrating the victory of World War II today, sir,‚Äô ‚Äù the president said. "Then I speak to another one, and they were celebrating. And the fact is, Russia was celebrating, France was celebrating, everybody was celebrating but us. And we're the ones that won the war."

"We won the war. And they helped, but without us, they don't win the war,‚Äù Trump continued. ‚ÄúWe're all speaking German. Without us, they're speaking German ‚Äî maybe a little Japanese too."

While the Allied Powers during the World War II were considered to be the U.S., United Kingdom and Soviet Union ‚Äî with China later joining, as they were already at war with Japan ‚Äî they were aided in fighting by troops from all over the world, including France, Poland, Canada, Australia, Norway, Greece, India, Brazil, Mexico, Philippines and many more.

However, Trump continued to insist on America's supremacy, noting that the U.S. "did a little bit more than France" in securing victory.
  78. Now do afghanistan!
  79. What a loser traitor!  The free world won that war.

This ü§° has no respect
  80. I laugh to think about what would have happened to the mango if he tried to duck conscription in Stalingrad because of his bone spurs.
  81. Holy shit he is batshit üòÇ Way to isolate yourself USA
  82. That‚Äôs like France mocking us for celebrating July 4th.¬†
  83. They think they are saviours. They avoided the war for years until they decided to join the side of the winners. They even gave weapons to the Soviet Union.
  84. Silly little boy.

Germany won the war, with 80 years delay.
Nazis and fascists all over the place in the U.S. government / Congress / population.
  85. Us tipped the scales after years long severe depletion and sacrifice from all 4 sides. 

4 time American combat Veteran here. 

#I stand with Europe
  86. One day soon, we will wake up to the news that he‚Äôs died.
  87. I'm so very sorry we(U.S.) are subjecting the world to this idiot. Sigh.
  88. Rich coming from a draft dodger.
  89. Like a weird reality-tv show from a retirement home showing the brabbling weird guy with dementia saying random slurs
  90. You could perhaps argue that he should thank the French for winning the war of independence. Without Napoleon's support, the USA would probably have remained a British colony for a good while longer
  91. When he took office, the bar was already on the ground‚Ä¶ but then he brought a shovel.
  92. Even if this is accurate (just to appease stupidity)... Who the hell wouldn't celebrate the end of Nazi occupation? I mean, maybe Nazis themselves....
  93. Pretty certain that without the UK and Russia, the US would have lost the war. 

Hell had Japan not attacked the US we would have sat out the war and allowed the Nazis to take over all of Europe, because let‚Äôs be honest the US supported Hitler and Mussolini
  94. *"I don't wanna be a wise guy"* - haha don't worry Donny you're anything but. 

He's the epitome of American ignorance. Fucking cunt.
  95. This article says that Macron is France's prime minister
  96. America is wild for electing this man. Wild!
  97. That‚Äôs the difference, they claim they won the war whilst Europe celebrate the end of the war. It‚Äôs not about who won it.
  98. As an American. I apologize for my countrymen and this baboon.
  99. \>US won the war







\>half of the continent remained under communism for 50 years

  
Smartest american
  100. Taking all the credit for the sacrifice of others while demonstrating an unbelievable amount of ignorance ad obnoxiousness.

That's basically Trump in a nutshell
  101. Do you think we'll have to pay to piss on his grave or it will be free?
  102. ‚ÄúThe Mocking President‚Äù arrives again and just can‚Äôt stop berating our allies. No unity DJT strikes again.
  103. Europeans please know that he does not speak for must of us, but for himself and also his puppet master.
  104. Someone in the comments under that article called him "Tangerine Voldemort" and that description couldn't be more accurate. lol
  105. Trump‚Äôs daily provocations aren‚Äôt random. They‚Äôre part of a¬†[deliberate strategy to dominate the news cycle by triggering predictable outrage](https://integ.substack.com/p/why-youre-unknowingly-volunteering). Don't help him by spreading his bullshit.
  106. It's time for all French people to start mocking america every time they celebrate their independence. After all, the french won the war.
  107. In his defense. He's an idiot.
  108. Is there any evidence he went to school?


People with dementia have forgotten more than this guy knows.¬†
  109. As an American who‚Äôs studied this period of time, I can say with certainty that he‚Äôs a complete idiot. 
I could go on at length about the contributions and terrible sacrifices made by Europeans both civilian and military. How he could say these things is just reprehensible! For myself and on behalf of my countrymen allow me to apologize for this insult.
  110. Bone spurs cowardice
  111. Showed up late and didn‚Äôt stick around long enough to learn any lessons about the rise of fascism.
  112. Umm Canada a Britain were there too. Im sure my great uncle and grandfather had a lot to do with winning it.
  113. He is the embodiment of the term ‚ÄúThe Ugly American !‚Äù
  114. trump is a brain dead muppet, he's only repeating what 90% of americans believe.
  115. US couldn't even beat Vietnam.
  116. When there‚Äôs no one to take the keys away from grandpa.
  117. The draft dodger that's owned by Putin and the Middle East. Hilarious, he's clearly in serious mental decline
  118. Yes, the allies won the war, and the US were a very substantial part of that. This was the old US, before it turned into the Christo-fascist shitshow.
  119. Everything he "knows" he "learned" from movies and TV.
  120. But I thought he said Russia won the war?
  121. That baby couldn‚Äôt find Europe on a map even if it hit him in the face with a pretzel, cheese, and good wine.¬†
  122. I hate to credit the Soviet Union with much but prior to D-Day they were responsible for about 90% of German casualties.  They also lost about ten million soldiers and about an equal number of civilians.  It took some time for the Germans to respect American forces but they were terrified of the Russians.  I in no way want to diminish the sacrifice of the US but we lost about 445k combatants compared to much higher numbers of our Allies.  And Britain held out at against the Nazis pretty much alone for two years.  Yes, American industrial might was crucial to the Allied victory but denigrating the efforts of our now apparently former Allies is not only historically inaccurate but morally reprehensible.  But that's who trump is, ignorant and nasty.
  123. In fact, most German troops were annihilated on the Eastern front, ie by the Soviet-Union.  Japan is a different story, that was overwhelmingly the US.
  124. My sincere apologies to Europe üá™üá∫.  Mr. trump has serious mental issues. I wonder if donald ever attended school.
  125. We all now it was mostly UK and ussr in Europe and africa
  126. Well....70 million people died, only 500,000 of those were american, you tell me which continent has a bigger right to celebrate their people not dying anymore?

Most countries had big sacrifices...
  127. I feel like Americans were making some progress of changing the reputation from being unintelligent, loud-mouthed braggarts in the last while, before they kept electing this guy.

In some ways if you have stereotypical negative views of Americans, he makes perfect sense as their president.
  128. Donald needs to get his facts straight... The Allies won WWII: France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. The US didn't fight the war alone.

In fact, the US is incapable of fighting any war by itself... the United States' most prominent defeats include: the Vietnam War, the US military's opium war in Afghanistan (also known as the War in Afghanistan), the Korean War, the American-Algerian War, the War of 1812, Red Cloud's War, the Formosa Expedition, the Bay of Bigs Invasion... Such losers...

As history recalls, the US was under Britain at some point... otherwise, there wouldn't be the 4th of July...
  129. "He is a great guy, we are very good friends. I know him very well. I believe he wants peace, I really believe it"

That's how it could have gone, if a certain someone was in charge back then.
  130. The zero sum kind of thinking of that guy is mind blowing. "We won so everyone else had to have lost"
  131. I am so sorry, y‚Äôall. I didn‚Äôt vote for him and he makes our country look like we don‚Äôt care. Please know that not all of us support what he says.
  132. And we had leaders like Churchill, De Gaulle, Roosevelt  despite having very different political and moral profiles    led their nations through an existential threat. Even when they made controversial decisions, they did so at a time when the stakes were global and it was clear who the aggressors were and who the victims were........... now we have Trump one big piece of human shit
  133. The war was won with British intelligence, Russian blood, American steel and Canadian bloodthirst for Germans
  134. I think it's excessive to get angry at this childish debate. "America carried the war" is such a childish meme at this point it's basically just a joke for old times sake. I really don't find this to be a big deal at all
  135. He should know. I'm sure he studied the war in great detail, and understands all the nuances better that anyone.
  136. I mean, this has been how the Americans rewrote history since decades, no wonder they have a candidate representing this nowadays.

Still, remember that people rewriting history have things to compensate for with such a discourse.
  137. Last time I checked it was the Canadians that freed my home town.
  138. If trump is so happy about America‚Äôs role in WWII, why did he disrespect the veterans buried in Normandy in his first term?
  139. I hate Donald Trump, but he didn't mock Europe.  I heard him speak, that wasn't mocking.
  140. It must be noted that not one member of the Trump family aided in that victory.
  141. All the history books remind us we came into the war at last moment when tipping point was in the Allies favor (roughly)....love the revisionist BS maga does.
  142. Britain and the Soviets had already started to defeat Germany before the Americans arrived. The Americans definitely shortened the war, though. Americans were far more important in the Pacific, but Hollywood spends most of its time with the war in Europe.
  143. I‚Äôm American and Trump is an absolute imbecile, it was undeniably a joint effort. The saying goes we won WWII with American Steel, British Intelligence, and Soviet Blood. To put this into perspective the US lost 400k lives in WWII, but Russia lost 27 MILLION. It‚Äôs sad to see the horrors that Russia is committing currently.
  144. USA did win the war we joined the war long after the war started and with the help of Canada, UK, Russia even the Mexicans helped with a million soldiers in Europe and a hundred thousand planes in Asia.
The victory belongs to everyone who participated even if America came out on top because the only place that was attacked was Hawaii leaving all the rest of America's infrastructure intact.
  145. 8647
  146. Part of the MAGA plan is to bury everyone in so much controversy that we forget that nothing we are seeing now is new.¬†


The question we all need to ask here is who actually won WWII? Because the "Nazi regime" was a concept, not just a long dead evil government.


https://time.com/5414055/american-nazi-sympathy-book/
  147. I wish his dementia would strengthen its course already
  148. Nobody won that war. Nobody wins any war. In war, everybody loses.
  149. He is half right, America and the USSR won WW2
  150. Russia won ww2
  151. there were no trumps to help in the War, and their never will be- a family of grifters, and dodgers one and all. parasitic scum.
  152. Making friends and influencing allies wherever he goes. It‚Äôs like every ‚Äúugly American‚Äù character trait rolled into a semi-sentient sausage slurry casing.
  153. The Soviet Union won WW2. America just popped in at the end for a participation trophy. >.>
  154. Nobody won the war. The Nazis lost it. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important. Big orange brickhead can‚Äôt see the forest for the trees.
  155. Trump is obsessed in his hatred of Europe. Shame he doesn‚Äôt hold the same contempt for the world‚Äôs tyrants and dictators. Helps that they‚Äôre cozying up to him with their false flattery and jumbo jet sized bribes, I suppose
  156. The man doesn't understand that some things aren't just about 'winning'.
  157. He‚Äôs such a dumb twat. My apologies to the rest of the world.
  158. tbh honest his reference about it are only Hollywood movies, i doubt he has touched a book on his life
  159. The Allied forces won WW2.
  160. But there's mass shootings in your country daily.. ok Donny
  161. Someone buy him a happy meal with toy and hide his fuckn phone.
  162. Honestly, whenever I talk to the average American (over the last couple of decades) they all think that the US won WW2, despite all the facts. I asked my American wife what these people learn in school and apparently its all American History and mostly wrong or blatant propaganda. No wonder they are in the state they are in now.
  163. Ask Donald when they celebrate their "Victory" on Vietnam and Afghanistan.
  164. He‚Äôs an embarrassment to the Earth
  165. Hes an idiot
  166. Source:  Old John Wayne movies.
  167. For fuck sakes.........
  168. What a Bag of Shit !
  169. So embarrassing
  170. Trump's daily agenda : 

1.say shit about some democratic country and /or any supporters of democracy; 

2.say something flatteringr or otherwise please some authoritarian or openly criminal regime; 

3.promice Americans rainbow unicorns
  171. 240,000 Americans died in WW2. 20,000,000 Russians Ukrainians died in WW2
  172. Typical Trump. Taking credit for something he had nothing to do with.
  173. I believe that before the Normandy landings in 1944, around 90% of Germany's WW2 casualties occurred on the Eastern Front. History isn't exactly Trump's strong suit.
  174. Yeah, after Americans hung the Europeans out to dry from 1938 to Pearl Harbor in December of 1941. Suppose Japan did not attack Pearl? Would the USA have intervened at all?
  175. He really is a complete twat. How on earth did this man become President!
  176. He‚Äôs becoming thought of as simply pathetic.
  177. r/ShitAmericansSay
  178. He just keep proving on a daily basis exactly what a pathetic man child he is !!!!!
  179. Why can't someone simply stuff a few Big Macs down his throat and stop this flow of nonsense?
  180. The US didn't even join the war until 1941. This revisionism is on par with Russian propaganda which also ignores 39-41.
  181. r/shitamericanssay
  182. What a cunt.
  183. None of the actual troops behind him are impressed.
  184. US HELPED win the war, we did not win it alone.

In fact, if the US had joined earlier countless lives could have been saved.
  185. The US won the war against the Japanese. We basically didn't do any ground work for shit against Italy or in africa, and Germany lost because they tried to fight 80% of europe across 2 continents and forgot the soviets had like 320 million more bodies to throw at them till they ran out. Yes we helped TREMENDOUSLY but it isnt as if everyone in north africa, europe, and china were completely doomed until we got there.
  186. The Russians are the ones that defeated the nazis. Stalingrad was the turning point as much as the west hares to admit it.
  187. Compared to Russia and Britain, they did fuck all.
  188. Just when you thought he couldn‚Äôt embarrass his country any more he goes and finds a new low.  To do it multiple times a day is pretty incredible.  With his constant string of finding new lows it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs playing a game of limbo with Satan and slowly working his way to hell.
  189. What an a$$hole
  190. Who cares what that moron says
  191. I mean even if he was right that the US won the war. Why wouldn't Europe still celebrate the fact that the war fucking ended?
  192. Such a stupid thing to say: the defeat of nazi Germany was an combined effort. If the UK had peaced out from where would the W.Allies launch the liberation of Europe?
If the USSR had fallen how would the americans defeat the 200+ divisions of the german army?
  193. this is the draft dodger who went to the D Day cemeteries in France and called them suckers.

There have been many great Americans but Trump is not one of them.  He is the absolute worst; a complete colossal compendium of character flaws without a single virtue
  194. While the US was instrumental in ending the war, Britain and the USSR carried until the US actually entered, plus if Britain or the USSR stopped fighting at any point the Normandy invasion would of been a massive failure

And this based off what I learned in an American history class, if anything the other Ally‚Äôs did more then I‚Äôm giving them credit
  195. As do most Americans that are ignorant of World War 2
  196. All his actions are hateful and hurtful. The world hates this man. Nothing nice about him
  197. Donald "Jokes" Trump
  198. Cocksucker let a nazi seig heil at the inauguration.
  199. The most stupid president ever.
  200. Tell that to my grandad who spent 3 years as a Japanese POW

=== POST #30 ===
**Title:** AFD classified rightwing extremist
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 23597
**Comments (95):**
  1. **The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has reassessed the AfD at federal level. According to this, there is no longer any doubt that the party as a whole is right-wing extremist.**

Previously, the AfD was classified as a right-wing extremist ‚Äúsuspected case‚Äù and monitored by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. This morning, the Federal Office informed the public that the party as a whole is now classified as a ‚Äúproven right-wing extremist organization‚Äù. A press release states that the evidence has ‚Äúintensified‚Äù, meaning that the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has proven that the AfD as a whole is right-wing extremist and against the free democratic basic order. The decision means a significant tightening of the assessment, but it does not come as a complete surprise.

**1,000-page report**

The basis for this is an extensive collection of material that has been repeatedly updated by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution: According to information from ARD-Hauptstadtstudio and SWR, the Federal Office's report comprises more than 1,000 pages and is intended to prove why the AfD is anti-constitutional in the opinion of the constitutional protectors. The decisive factors are violations of human dignity, the rule of law or the principle of democracy, and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution distinguishes between test cases, suspected cases and "proven extremist tendencies". The AfD was initially classified as a test case by the Federal Office at federal level in 2019. At this stage, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is only allowed to collect and evaluate public statements made by AfD functionaries, and the AfD resisted both the observation by the domestic intelligence service and the fact that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution made this evaluation public from day one. In February 2021, the AfD was upgraded to a suspected right-wing extremist party, which was initially declared lawful by the Cologne Administrative Court and, in May 2024, also by the M√ºnster Higher Administrative Court after the party filed a lawsuit.

**Observation of the AfD**

With the classification as a suspected case, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution may also use so-called intelligence means for observation, such as recruiting human sources or conducting financial investigations. Measures to monitor communications are also permitted, but only with the prior approval of the G10 Commission of the German Bundestag. A final decision by the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig on the question of whether the classification as a suspected case is lawful is still pending. However, this is no longer about the substantive justification, but solely about possible procedural errors in the classification. In its ruling, the M√ºnster Higher Administrative Court had also called on the Office for the Protection of the Constitution to come to an assessment soon as to whether the suspicion of extremism had been confirmed or not.

The upgrade to "proven right-wing extremist organization" had already been expected last year. According to reports, however, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution initially refrained from doing so due to the early Bundestag elections, so as not to be accused of violating the equal opportunities of the parties in the election campaign.it is considered certain that the AfD will also take legal action against the reassessment by the Federal Office. In public, the AfD has always described the observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution as politically motivated. Individual state associations of the party have already been classified as proven right-wing extremist: in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. As of today, the federal party has also been classified.

**Will there be a ban procedure?**

The reassessment by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is likely to reignite the debate about banning the AfD. However, there is no automaticity: the assessment as "proven right-wing extremist" is neither a prerequisite for this, nor is a ban procedure the inevitable consequence.it is rather a political decision: a ban procedure can only be initiated by the Bundestag, Bundesrat and Federal Government by applying to the Federal Constitutional Court, which then has to decide on it.an initiative for a ban application from the middle of the Bundestag, initiated by the then CDU member of the Bundestag Marco Wanderwitz, failed in January because there were not enough supporters.
  2. For all those who can read German (or translate it online), I highly recommend the 1000-page explanatory memorandum, which meticulously collects evidence as to why the Afd was already a suspected case and what is problematic about them considering the preservation of the free democratic basic order and maintenance of the German constitutional state:



[https://netzpolitik.org/2025/verdachtsfall-rechtsextremismus-wir-veroeffentlichen-das-1-000-seitige-verfassungsschutz-gutachten-zur-afd/#2021-02-22\_BfV\_AfD\_Folgegutachten\_D-IV](https://netzpolitik.org/2025/verdachtsfall-rechtsextremismus-wir-veroeffentlichen-das-1-000-seitige-verfassungsschutz-gutachten-zur-afd/#2021-02-22_BfV_AfD_Folgegutachten_D-IV)
  3. To all the people who say "No shit Sherlock": Unlike just saying it this has consequences. One example is that the intelligence service now has pretty much free reign to do what they want regarding the AfD
  4. Great, I'm sure the German Government will now act accordingly and definitely won't drag their feet and do everything they can to ensure Fascists run in elections...
  5. 20.8% at the last election, between 23% and 26% in the latest polls.
  6. Man finally that step is fucking crucial in german law world.
Lets see what comes of it
  8. Just last week I attended a counter-AfD rally, and what struck me most was the disconnect between some of their supporters and the ideology they embrace. Among their most vocal ranks, there are individuals with visible disabilities or signs of developmental challenges. This isn't to mock or demean‚Äîbut rather to highlight the tragic irony.

The Nazi regime, which many AfD supporters indirectly glorify, systematically murdered people with physical and mental disabilities under Aktion T4. It's heartbreaking that some of those who might have been targeted under that regime are now defending a movement with roots in such ideology.

Adding to the contradictions, Alice Weidel, a co-leader of the AfD, lives in open contrast to her party‚Äôs stance‚Äîshe is in a same-sex partnership with a woman of Sri Lankan origin. The hypocrisy is staggering.

It‚Äôs as irrational as it is sad.
  9. The 2nd most popular party in the country?  The one that more than 1 of every 5 Germans support?  

There is a much deeper problem.  A problem that is not going away because AfD is so categorized.  It seems like mainstream Politiker/in have spent years trying to wish the AfD away and now they've changed tact... but without addressing WHY the AfD has become so popular.
  11. Lovely. And these are the people who say they are looking to the danish social democrats for inspiration on how to be "tough on immigration". Lovely.
  12. Can they be finally banned now? 

Not in 10 more years. Now.
  13. People dunking on the Germans for being slow to classify water as wet should look at their own countries.

These cunts are in parliaments and even governments all over Europe. Doing Putin and Trump's dirty work amongst other things. Traitors and Nazis, all of them.
  14. As an Ausl√§nder in Germany it's nice to see the locals protesting AfD and their Nazism almost every week and having something to show for it. Thanks guys.
  15. Next on the news: The German Government finds that the sky is blue
  16. Fascism worldwide has been in the rise since 2016 but after trump destroys america I think most countries will say no thanks Canada and Australia recently rebuked their trump wannabes
  17. If a democracy of a people that have brought havoc under a right wing tyranny upon the world, don‚Äôt forbid and fight against a new right wing movement that now has been declared as extremist by their own domestic intelligence services; what worth is that society, and its democracy?
  18. Like I give a fuck what current institutions deem extreme right lol
  19. *extremist party does extremist things*

germany: Hey you are extremist

certain comments: *how dare you?!*
  20. And NOTHING will happen. Sad.
  21. So this means that the party as a whole can be banned, correct?
  22. chanting "Alice fur Deutchland" was a hard to miss 'clue'
  23. Wish we could do the same to MAGA here in the states but they're inside the government already. Have been for awhile now unfortunately.
  25. Next week when AFD gains even more support: AFD classified right wing super duper extremist¬†
  26. "The ends justify the means"...here we go again...
  27. Ok phew, everyone is going to vote center left now. Glad they fixed that problem
  28. Isn't this the best thing for an anti-government party like the AFD? 

To their supporters, it proves that the government is trying to suppress them. 

It's the classic first step to starting a cult.   
1. Create a US v THEM battle

  
Now it seems, from the headlines, that this is what's happening. 

Young people always rebel against the system. Isn't this effectively driving them into their hands? 

  
Time will tell.
  29. Can a party be classified as left wing extremism, and what would that look like?
  30. The second most popular and soon to be most popular party in Germany?

lol this is going to have the exact opposite effect that people here want
  31. Holy shit these comments do NOT know what the paradox of tolerance is and it shows.
  32. Good. Tolerance cannot extend to inherently intolerant.
  33. Discussing this with my partner in the UK where we're seeing the right-leaning voters heading for more right-wing parties.\*  This is not what I think.  But what about the argument that if you ban stuff, it makes people go for it more?  My partner articulated this a bit better, but stuff about politicians telling people how to think and so on, rather than having better arguments.

\*Reform in the UK won a bunch of local council elections held yesterday.

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c39jedewxp8t](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c39jedewxp8t)

For context if you don't know, Farage was the driver of convincing people Brexit was a good idea.  :-(

Reform's voter base, if you go on the forums, is more right wing and racist etc than what comes out of the mouths of their official politicians.

Farage seems to say what they want to hear, making spurious arguments about people not doing well because of whatever scapegoat or issue is handy at the time.
  34. Ban the opposition!
  35. Standard European "democracy"
  36. Banning it will not make the followers disappear.The problem lies deep within
  37. What's in the way of banning BSW?
  38. I'm a conservative myself, but the AfD has made it so obvious what they truly are that I'd rather vote SPD just to avoid the potential of a coalition with the AfD. 

Copy pasting Hitler's political tactics is not particularly subtle
  39. grass is green
  40. FINALLY! ü•≥
  41. You have to realise though¬†the European love affair with ineffectual centrist technocratic governments is ending. People want progress on issues they care about from economic growth to immigration reform. All the excuses have been used.


We made the rise of the far-right near inevitable in Europe because we kept electing dead end governments. We must make our peace with the far-right.
  42. This is great, but what are the legal implications? Are members still allowed to hold public office?
  43. shocked pikachu.jpg
  44. Now do Reform
  45. is afd more right wing than trump or less?
  46. So the US would be harboring and promoting an extremist fun world I live in
  47. Finally.
  48. Democracy for me but not for thee
  49. about fucking time, now ban these neo Nazis
  51. The AFD got 20% of the vote in the last federal elections. Regardless of the reasoning behind it, going after a party that has so much support will inevitably make people feel disillusioned with the political process and feel they need to take more direct means to achieve their goals.

A peaceful society must allow all people to be represented in the democratic process whether you agree with their views or not.
  52. About 8-9 years too late.
  53. Aren't the AFD outright called the Nazi party in Germany?
  54. No shit
  55. Germany has to treat the infection, rather than putting a band-aid over it and pretending it‚Äôs not there anymore.

Germany will make the same mistake that the Weimar Republic made in 1923 and came back to hit them 10 years later.
  56. The fascist will cry ‚ÄúI thought you believed in democracy‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you believed in free speech‚Äù and then as soon as they are given a platform you will no longer have these things as they don‚Äôt believe in them. It should be unapologetically wiped out before it gets any foothold, or you lose everything, and millions die¬†
  57. Can Germany pool Belgium on them and have AfD face a media and civil blackout on top of the political firewall? Please?
  58. Herr Musk endorsed, yep, extremists.
  59. Excellent!
  60. So many non german people are gonna be very mad at this.
  61. Good. Fuck them.
  62. Banning political parties is good when WE do it guys! They're so fascist, they want to end democracy, so we must end democracy so that the people don't vote them iN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  63. Classed by whom, left wingers?
  64. Well, it was finally time. Now when is it getting banned?
  65. I dislike the AfD, therefore it is good to use the power of the government to label them as extremists right after they won the second most seats in the Bundestag. 

I see no double standard here
  66. Finally! I hope this will lead to the following:

1. A swift end to any federal financial contributions to the party.
2.  An end to the normalization of fascist ideology and talking points.
3. A timely ban of the whole party.
4. A ban for all members of the party to work in any public job or hold any public office
5. A strict and rigorous persecution of any and all crimes and violations against the law and constitution which have been or will be uncovered by the security agencies.
6. A wake-up call for many of their voters, or at least a sign that they can't openly associate with and support an extremist party and ideology.
7. The destruction of major fascist political structures in Germany for at least some years.
  69. Good. 

Germans who vote for them now have 0 excuses. 

It‚Äôs only been 80 years since the first ‚Äòde-nazification‚Äô campaign.
  70. Good. Now can we investigate Reform, and their anonymous donors.
  71. This is the best news of the day, by far.
  72. Russian bots and the whataboutist are working overtime in this thread
  73. Europe trying to ban parties that are doing well will definitely be remembered when they claim that the US isn‚Äôt democratic. You guys elect your leaders with 20-30% of the vote, can often schedule elections when you are polling well, receive an unfair amount of seats for the amount of votes you win, and ban the political parties that are winning. There is truly no democracy in Europe.
  74. Wake up and follow your constitution and end this now, stop the spread of global fascism at all costs¬†
  75. Well of course they are, just look at their attitude towards the Holocaust
  76. I mean, good, but I'm worried that this will make AFD supporters even more angry and cause some sort of violence - and considering East Germany was pretty much all AFD in the elections...
  77. This is how you get people to riot
  78. Can we stop fucking banning people from disagreeing?
  79. Parties that should be classified as a threat for democracy in italy:

* Lega
* Five Star Movement
* Power to the people
* the future party of vannacci
* sovereign and popular democracy
* forza italia
* brothers of italy
* anything that is classified as far right/far left or that proves the point of the horseshoe theory
* italexit (if it even is still alive)

and i'm sure i'm forgetting some entities
  80. Liberal "democracy" moment
  82. I suppose that occupying the power and banning opposition all across Europe will only result in a revolution at some point. 

I hope you are all aware of the soft totalitarianism happening regardless what kind of propaganda you are fed.
  83. They're Nazis. I don't know why people tip-toe around it. They are the contemporary version of the Nazis.
  84. üëçüèº
  85. Nature is healing
  86. Good. They need to ban everyone involved from ever running for or holding political office ever again in their lives. Stop taking the high road with these people and stamp them out.
  87. Is this the one Elon helps with money?
  88. Wont be surprised if they win next
  89. Let's not get our hopes up.

I have every confidence that the new conservative government with fuck it up by inaction.

And our courts have always been too soft on right-wing extremists.

Just look at how light cops known to be rightwing extremists, which is supposed to be a fireable offense, constantly get off.

At best the CDU/CSU might take some half-assed action out of self interest.
  90. This is news? The literal New Nazis are extremists? Woooowww
  91. About time
  92. If you dont take action against parties that actively want to undermine democracy, you end up with a party like the Golden Dawn, or even worse, you end up like the US. We need to learn from other's mistakes
  93. Imagine that a Europeans calling a party far right and the majority of those same people in the comment section asking for them to be banned. 
You can't make this stuff up how delusional Europeans have become. What happened to you idiots.
  94. Truly a failed democracy. Banning a party that a 4th of the country id voting for instead of solving the issue of why people are voting for it.

Anxwax banning other parties is like the least democratic thing ever no matter how bad a party is or if they are "undemocratic*.
  95. Denmark has a focus on deterring asylum seekers and promoting return. The government has implemented measures like strengthening border controls, revoking residency permits, and even considering reception centers outside Europe. Additionally, Denmark has introduced policies like "ghetto laws" targeting immigrant-heavy communities and has moved a subsection of failed asylum seekers to an isolated island.  Is Denmark 'right wing extremist'?

=== POST #31 ===
**Title:** Germany‚Äôs Foreign Ministry just gave Marco Rubio a lesson in basic democratic values:
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 23490
**Comments (159):**
  1. The irony is that, this is what the Allies demanded that the German did after WW2
  2. "Tyranny in disguise". Aren't they talking about themselves?
  3. By historic standards Rubio‚Äôs comment is extremely aggressive towards the largest European country and any concerns would normally have been expressed in diplomatic language in private. This is how far the US has fallen in just over 100 days.
  4. ‚ÄûGermans just gave‚Ä¶‚Äú!?!?!? It‚Äôs in the constitution the allies helped us write 80 years ago you complete failure of a human‚Ä¶ ffs!
  7. Keep antagonising Germany, keep meddling in German affairs, keep up the confrontational and shameless tone and see where it will get you. 

The more they do this, the more Germany will throw its weight around in the EU in support of strategic autonomy and "Gaullism". 

It's an historic achievement of the current American administration to utterly disgust the vast majority of the German political elites and the public so much that they are moving away from one of the main pillars of German foreign policy since WW2 - the "Westbindung" (transatlantic alliance). It's a truly herculean effort to do in a few months what France couldn't in 80 years, despite the very close cooperation. 

Just like Putin destroyed the last illusions many (unfortunately not all) traditionally Russophile Germans had about Russia, so do Trump and his cronies for the US.
  8. Because MAGA is an extremist group as well thinly disguised as ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù which they are not
  9. An accomplice of a tyrannical regime gives lessons in democracy to an official of a much more democratic country...

That's not just ironic, it's disgusting.

Claiming that the government is always right, is already defending totalitarianism.
  10. No tolerance for the intolerant
  11. Calling Germany tyrannical while doing deportations without due process.

People living in glass houses shouldn't throw rocks.
  12. if those americans could read, they would be very upset!
  13. Go, Germany üí™‚ù§Ô∏è
  14. Friendly reminder that multiple AfD politicians are currently under investiagtions for hoarding weapons and preparing an 'ethnic cleansing'.  
This is not about banning opposition. This is about preventing 1933.
  15. Seems like Germany has had bad experiences with right-wing extremists in the past.
  16. This is also factually wrong. The Verfassungsschutz ( our "spy agency" according to Rubio) already had powers to surveil der AfD, because it was a "rechtsextremer Verdachtsfall" for years (meaning: the AfD was, because of its public statements already under surveillance, because the suspicion against the rule of law was already there, for years).  
\+ to that: the AfD youth organisation, the AfD on many state levels and many members were already known to be proven right wing extremist.  


Democracy has to defend itself.
  17. Honestly, thanks to those in the comments who have opened my eyes into the investigation, what it means for democracy and why this is important based on history.¬†


If only more people understood rather than jumping on the "anti-democratic" bandwagon.
  18. As a German I fully agree with the statement and quite proud of their response. I would have not phrased it so civil...but that's why I could never be a politician...would just tell that dude to f*** off and stay away from our couches...
  19. Americans alway loved to destroy other countries by meddling in their politics, assassinating candidates, etc. 

Today they're complete puppets of Russia and don't even recognize it. Never thought Russia would win the cold war! How the turn tables
  20. Rubios tweet reads as chat gpt
  21. So many of the comments here really make me feel worried about our future. Where do people educate themselves on constitutional and democratic principles and topics, TikTok and Twitter?
  22. Marco: "Tyranny in disguise."

Germany: "Democracy enforced!"

Tell 'em!
  23. What a dignified response looks like. Germany could have easily said something like "Anyone working for your boss has no place telling us what tyranny looks like."
  24. when i still was on X it was baffling to say the least how little understanding there was about the actual policy of the Afd. one could point out the actual nazi-incidents and maga-americans still mumbled shit about free speech, left wing propaganda etc. so, either they are wilfully ignorant nazis or incredibly fucking stupid. it is truly shocking
  25. As a European, it feels like "finally, some leadership". Long overdue.
  26. "learnt from our history" is the point where americans will stop to read.
  27. The US needs to stop peddling their views like it's the alma matter of politics world wide.

And we need to stop them from influencing EU internal Politics.
  28. He'd be so pissed if he knew what those words mean....
  29. Marco is a joke and sold out big time. I hope his decisions haunt him.
  30. I really don't get the point of the secretary of state antagonizing with baseless claims like this. Doing lasting damage to the USA's international standing for what, internet points from the musk croud?

They are so focused on 'making deals' but then have their most important foreign facing person do unserious stuff like this. Imagine having to negotiate with someone like this.
  31. Their "spy agency"?! Which kindergarten does he work for/in?!
  32. Marco is now part of an authoritarian cult that threatens our democracy and way of life, not different than nazi Germany so of course he‚Äôs going to say this shit.
  33. Trump and little marco will turn America into the new afd
  34. If the Trump admin is so ‚ÄúAmerican first‚Äù why won‚Äôt they shut the fuck up about EVERY other nation? It‚Äôs always nonstop about what every other country is doing, especially if it doesn‚Äôt immensely benefit whatever right wing party is involved. If americas in such dire straits like they‚Äôre always saying, why not shut the fuck up and try to fix it instead?
  35. "hey fellas, is it extremism to stop fascists from taking over your country?"
  36. Rubio knows this. He's just a bad faith actor as anyone important in the Trump regime.
  37. Very predictable. I want to thank the US for being stupid enough to elect these fools so that the rest of the world does not follow suit and can act against it. Thanks for making the blueprint of what not to do, you fucking idiots.
  38. interesting....

anyway GOATED Germany
  39. Wanna know what‚Äôs a dictatorship? Look at orban and erdogan then, they‚Äôve arrested the opposition and the U.S. hasn‚Äôt said shit.
  40. The country that sends minorities to concentration camps in El Salvador without trial is complaining about tyranny.
  41. Yes we can stand up to radicals like Rubio and Trump!!
  42. Pretty sure, he can‚Äôt grasp what ‚Äûindependent‚Äú really means. 

It‚Äôs just another fancy word for him and his cronies.
  43. BASED Germans üòç
  44. It's funny how these socaled free speech absolutists are incredibly selective about their outrage. 

People are being "disappeared" from the streets of the United States, but suddenly Marco Rubio can remember words like 'tyranny in disquise'. 

I guess the tyranny is out in the open in the administration he is working for.
  45. The "open borders" claim is a lie too. Not only the Schengen borders are guarded with ever-increasing strictness, Germany has reintroduced checks at its own borders.
  46. Trump should not be a president, he should be in jail.
  47. It shows that they don't know how courts work
  48. "The popular AfD which took second in the recent elections" LOL like he would say this for the Dems who placed a much closer second and who are being "investigated" by the Republican-controlled US government.
  49. The good thing about this kind of US remarks is that it will strenghten our resolve to stand united and uphold the highest democratic standards. Europe must be the beacon of democracy, otherwise there are dark times ahead.
  50. I think Rubio is totally slapable. An arrogant boy holding his nose and only hitching up to trump to advance his own career. 

And his point about tyranny is bullshit. It's ok for German intelligence to keep an eye on threats to the constitution. And afd has some members with views that threaten the constitution. Specifically, the view that people who don't have a german lineage can be stripped of their German citizenship and excluded from the country. That's a very dangerous idea.

But I came here to say. If the afd legitimately get into power and legally change the constitution to remove the protection for those people, then it would be just as dangerous for the german state to work against the democratically elected authority in the land. 

I see a lot of troubling things about Germany lately. There is an emerging feeling that there is an elite class of officials that have appointed themselves as the guards the "real" values of germany. You see it from Merkel who said that Israel's security should be treated as an extension of Germany's security. That isn't illegal, until Germany steps over someone actual legal rights to uphold an non legal official maxim like that. This happened recently with the Irish protestors for Palestinian being stripped of their right to live and work in Berlin. 

And now we see the foreign office not being very careful to distinguish a threat to the unofficial state posed by afd people who want to legally change the constitution, to a group using force  or illegal means to threaten German citizens rights under the current constitution.

It's all quite concerning that official Germany is setting up to resist a democratically elected govt and justifying everything with things that happened in WW2. As if one is always the same as the other.
  51. Germany is insulted everyday by US but still has its military bases. If they have really some pride, Germans should expel all US soldiers from Germany.
  52. It is NOT antidemocratic to deny antidemocratic parties the opportunity to destroy democracy.

Same as it's not making a person intolerant, if they are intolerant towards an intolerant person. Stop denying the humanity of other people and we will stop being *intolerant* towards them. But if we stop. They just double down. Cause they are fundamentally opportunistic assholes. 

If you don't fight antidemocratic movements, if you don't fight intolerance. Then there will be no democracy. There will be no harmony, no peace. 

Antidemocratic, authoritarian movements, will demand more and more, if you treat them with respect. They will spit on you and deny you your humanity whenever they get the chance. 

The same goes for intolerant people. They need their fix. They will find a new trait to harass to satisfy their urge for superiority.  If you don't fight them, they'll take everything and more.
  53. To all the Americans who still think that the AfD is basically just "like the GOP": Trump wanted to stop illegals from crossing the border by building a wall. AfD leadership suggested to just shoot them.


So if you haven't experienced anything about¬†the AfD like us Germans did for decades now, just STFU please.
  54. That's the usual fake news from the usual fascists.

No new powers were given. They just applied the laws, that were in place for decades.  
You run a openly fascist party -> law applies. Very simple.

Btw: those laws are in place, because Germany already had a fascist government and wants to protect it's democracy from people like Rubio.
  55. Who is taking American politicians serious in 2025 tho? Everything they say is to deceive and divide their own people, to control them.
  56. Shots fired!
  57. As a german all I can say: k√ºmmert euch um euren eigenen scheiss ihr diabetiker
  58. Well played, GermanForeignOffice. Probably too high for him, but the only way to reply to this uneducated idiot.
  59. Genuine question: what does that have to do with democracy? 

Democracy is letting the population vote for things. An investigation is not related to democracy
  60. Marco Rubio is an Imbecile
  61. A reminder if it's needed that ISIS is also a political movement. There are some forms of politics that are outside the bounds of acceptability in a modern democracy.
  62. This just goes to show how dismal it is for Americans like me who don‚Äôt want any of this nonsensical hatred being enacted. This man can‚Äôt understand the difference between a political process (democracy) and making noise with ‚Äòbuzzword‚Äô vibes (that‚Äôs not democracy). Our leaders don‚Äôt want an intelligent populace, but rather a brain dead drone workforce to serve the oligarchy. He should be struck down with the full force of the law. SIC SEMPER TYRRANUS!!!
  63. He is entirely correct. This is democracy, and it's why pure democracy is a terrible idea.


Pure democracy allows the tyranny of the majority in which momentary panics remove the rights of others.¬†
  64. If I had a Shitter account, I'd give them mad props right now
  65. Plain censorship just means Basic Democratic Values now
  66. Could have gone low and replied "at least we're not deporting people to foreign gulags without due process and we intend to keep it that way, hence the investigation."
  67. it's not enough. why not remind that Rubio person to stfu and look at his own fascist regime and that the world is not as idiotic as half of US americans. We see you. And we detest you.
  68. Rubio just got schooled.
  69. What makes me laugh is how the likes of Trump and his sycophants talk as if they were absolutely, in no way the eStaBlIshMenT.

LOL a senator who has run for president (and was personally insulted by Trump) at the service of a twice president born a millionaire (maybe billionaire, but Trump is a compulsive liar, so who knows). 

Literally zero self awareness
  70. I'm gonna have to agree with Germany here. If there's any country that's an expert in noticing fascism or authoritarianism, it's the country that literally had a fascist regime once upon a time and fought tooth and nail to not have it repeat in the last 80 years.
  72. I didn't know he could read...
  73. As an American, please continue to wipe the floor with our currently elected officials. We are so tired.
  74. Fucking diplomacy on twitter. This timeline sucks.
  75. Can US politicians please SHUT THE FUCK UP when it comes to other countries' internal affairs? You do your fascist crap in your country but leave us the fuck alone.
  76. US giving democracy lessons...
  77. This so called "new spy agency" is not a new agency, but existed long ago with the support of WW2 allies, incl. the US, to have an eye on unconstitutional activities. This constitution was created with the help of the US, uphold by the german people and unlike in the US, we are trying to conserve it.

Since europeans are sent back at the US border, held in captivity even, students at universities being sent back to their home countries just for having an opinion - the foreign secretary of that very country should also be rejected in Europe from entering!

A fascist government, claiming for rights of speech in other countries - how rediculous is that?
  78. Every accusation that the current American government is doing, is a self admition...
  79. Morons. All our neighbours are part of Schengen. Open borders is a central part of the European vision.
  80. Yeah I am not a fan of what most of the Political Parties in Germany do, and I admit I voted for them once before, but their stance on Russia is what finally opened my eyes.

To any AfD Voters reading this: It‚Äòs not the foreigners fault this country is going to shit. It‚Äòs the widening gap between rich and poor and the flow of wealth in the form of assets from the bottom to the top. And NO party, especially not the AfD, has answers for that.

I would describe myself als patriotic. This is why I will never support a party that is advocating or even collaborating with an entity that seeks to undermine our freedom, values and rights, and entity that wants to invade and conquer our neighbors and allies. We know from our history, and from all of history, that this kind of behavior ALWAYS ends the same way.

If you are a patriot I really feel with you. This current situation is bad. But kicking out foreigners and cuddling up to an imperialist dictator is NOT the way. This has not worked before and it will not work this time.

Don‚Äòt get me wrong, I really don‚Äòt advocate for communism or socialism - but we need to talk about wealth inequality as driving force behind most of the problems we face today and deal with that adequately, or NOTHING will ever change and everything will just keep getting worse.

I know this was kind of off topic, but I know there are a lot of silent AfD Voters here who are just so fed up with the way things are developing.

I know what you feel like. I know money is tight. I know you have dreams and ambitions. I know you work hard. I know it really makes you angry when you see these out of touch politicians talk shit on TV. I feel you and I agree 100%.

But it‚Äòs not the foreigners fault. And the AfD has NO solution to the core problem - but the other parties also do not.

So if you are a patriot and fed up with how things are going: Educate yourself about wealth inequality, the stock market, the flow of assets and what that really means for all of us and you will get a really good look behind the curtain.

And that‚Äòs also true for most Americans. The tariffs show that even the Trump administration understood the issue with asset flow and are ready to tank the economy to have it transform itself over a very long time; but that is also only a bandaid. There are certain rules in international trade. Inform yourself what really happens when one nation has a trade deficit with another country. This will not fix the housing prices in the short term. In ten years or so, if the administration keeps it up and your local production change, maybe. There are a lot of things at play here. But think about it this way: The sweatpants you buy are mostly made in Cambodia where labor is cheap. Trump wants to make local US production competitive with products made in countries with cheap labor, like Cambodia. Now think it through: Cambodia is one of the poorest nations on earth, yet was hit with some of the biggest tariffs by Trump. Still, if you would make these products in the US, image how low the pay would have to be to still be to get to a competitive price for produced goods. Do you want to work for $4 and hour? Is that an economy you want? I don‚Äòt think so.

I could go on for hours and hours writing about this, but I think I already took it too far. Thanks for coming to my TED talk I guess. 

Hate never wins.
  81. I'm more so baffled as the German Foreign Office listed things that aren't intrinsically "democracy." Independent investigations and courts are the separation of powers, not democracy. Democracy would be, for better or worse, making it for the general public to decide through the electoral process or some similar mechanism that actually involves voting.

Also I'm tired of Germany saying "they learned about the dangers of the far-right." No they didn't, they totally fell for it and had to be violently stopped. Poland learned of the dangers, Belgium and the Netherlands learned from the danger, even Russia learned from the danger; Germany was the danger that had to be stopped. Why would being the ones who did elect and empower far-right extremism make your opinions carry more weight than the people who never did that?
  82. Germany giving us a lesson on how not to be Nazis is ironic and hilariously funny
  83. The NSDAP was also democratically elected. Twelve years later there were 60 million dead. 
No, Mr. Rubio. A democracy must also be able to defend itself.
  84. How in the flying fuck is it democracy if judiciary can fn ban parties, wtf are you people smoking. 

Separation of powers, anyone?!

Disgusting.
  85. The point is that the democratic opinion is based on the honest truth. No lies, no blatant alternative facts, no extrem intolerance to minorities respecting law and order defined by the fundamental constitution and human rights as accepted by the majority of the population.

The AfD does not respect the fundamental values of the ‚Äûconstitution‚Äú and puts the free democratic future of the majority at risk.

With the AfD a ‚Äûmajority‚Äú is 25%. The problem is that explicitly 50% is against the AfD.
  86. ‚ÄúDemocracy is when silencing political opponents‚Äù
  87. 1945 - USA de-nazifies (West-)Germany

2025 - USA re-nazifies Germany

What a turn of history üò±
  88. Ah yes Germany who was just a few years ago was leading the charge in dictating terms to it's EU partners about exactly what laws they would be forced to push through their parliaments all of a sudden does not like people meddling in it's internal affairs... 

Let me get the world's smallest violin to paly for them.
  89. good.

the louder they bark, the more right we are!
  90. This is fucking hysterical given that we are learning in real-time the necessity of our own 'complex and cumbersome' institutions with thirty judges nominated by three branches in two different votes. Meanwhile in the USA they have a constitutional court that is literally just 'yeah the president gets first dibs on each of them with only simple majority parliament approval and then they stay for life'.
  91. I mean, despite me beliving it is a bit ironic to block a party from having public administrators when it is already represented in parliament and ( if current trends are sustained) the single largest fraction of the electorate, I was not expecting that coment from One of the least squizo members of Trump's administation. 

I would just like to remember One thing though. These laws that are used to "protect democracy" as you say, migth one day be used against you if an extreme rigth government comes to power. 

All _cordon-sanitaires_ that I can list failed or are in the process of failing. Only countries that didnt implement them  dealt sucessfully with their extremes movements.
  92. Too bad MAGAts can't read.
  93. It had to come this far that the foreign minister of the US - the shining idol of freedom and rule of costitutional rights that we believed in since my childhood days - publicly and offiicially delivers his obstructed views on what ‚Äûdemocracy‚Äú is to serve a autocratic and corrupt oligarchy of rich fools. It is utterly sad.
  95. "We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped." Except when it's Israel, then we send them weapons so they can commit genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians... F Trump and his whole regime, but sadly Germany has really destroyed its credibility over the last 2 years, and most "democratic" parties have tarnished their reputation by supporting Netanyahu and the Israeli fascists. Labeling the AFD as an rightwing extremist party has long been overdue though. Good on the courts, it's a good step forward at least.
  96. Germany has learned. US are learning right now.
  97. They should have ended with ‚ÄúThe USA was here, wasn‚Äôt anyone paying attention?.
  98. Why do all Americans politicians pretend the US doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsurveil the opposition?‚Äù That‚Äôs all the fucking CIA does and it‚Äôs how America has always done business.
  99. imagine, an american minister talking about the establishment \*giggle\*

that said, these two points ... a organisation, beeing extremist and unregulated migration causing problems aren't exclusive to each other, they can both be true at the same time!
  100. Ok, one problem is that the AfD keeps playing with the Nazis. Weidel said in an interview that there is nothing to celebrate on the D-day. They keep using post-WWII extreme right rhetoric that was popular in very small, hidden nazi circles in the last 80 years. The question is why they do it and how many in the party actually believe that stuff. My guess is that a fraction of the party is highly opportunistic, so even nazi ideas are fine as long as they grant them influence and power, but in the lower ranks is full of real nazis because these were the only people that they could recruit here and there.   
But regardless of what Rubio says, every country has to live/deal somehow with extreme right parties, I think Germany has to learn to do it as well, eventually. Years ago, these hardcore conservatives were hidden in the CDU and had to be very disciplined, christian, well-behaved etc. They existed, but they had to keep a certain low profile so they wouldn't go around babbling about nazi stuff. They would however maybe say that it's sad that we lost Breslau or Stettin because they were so nice. Or they would show support for a high-ranking official of the Wehrmacht who massacred civilians in Italy or Poland. Only that people don't remember that anymore after 50-60 years. After all you cannot pretend that because something terrible happened 80 years ago then your population is somehow special and therefore people with far right ideas do not exist because you taught them in school that the Nazis were bad.
  101. Guys please don‚Äôt bully the hero of Venezuela he‚Äôs the only one that can stop communism worldwide, because everyone that doesn‚Äôt support his far right friends is a commie to him.
  102. I love how the mood in this sub has shifted because of Trump. Last year, you have many people here defending the AfD's "Madagascar Plan", as discussed in the notorious "Potsdam Conference", screaming instead that "fAr lEfT eXtrEmIsM iS mOre dAngErOus!!!"
  103. Rubio used chatgpt to write that. What a fucking tool.
  104. Lil Marco‚Äôs sure got a lot of time on his hands for a guy with two jobs.
  105. Fair dues to the GFO putting Rubio in his place
  106. Magfocus knlng sa bansa mo. Wag kana umepal sa issue ng ibang bansa na affected ang mga pinoy. Respect lng.
  107. Why Rubio even care tf?
  108. well done. now if America had learned from your history. unfortunately that would require Americans to learn something.
  109. He will yell back soon.
  110. Right wingers deserve no respect, no consideration, and no rights.
  111. If only Merrick Garland, Biden‚Äôs AG, had ever learned that lesson‚Ä¶
  112. Did the Trump regime literally learn nothing from how their interference ended up taking the Conservative Party of Canada from a +25 point lead in January to an election loss last week?
  113. Germany we need your help‚Ä¶.
  114. If they are trully "indipendent" he's absolutely correct. If they are as "indipendent" as courts in other countries, he's just pretending and Rubio stands correct.
  115. For it to be a lesson one must be smart enough to learn from it.  Rubio is not.
  116. What exactly happens now that Germany has designated AFD as a far right org? Just asking because I‚Äôm from the states and don‚Äôt know what happens after that designation. Are they now illegitimate and they lose their seats? Are they barred from running in future elections?
  117. Gestapo Rubio can suck a nut!!!
  118. In Europe, we would appreciate that Peskov or Lavrov said themselves this kind of things, instead of sending us the valet as always
  119. Rubio wrote it with ChatGPT
  120. MAGA: "Surveiling an extremist hate group is tyranny!"

Germans: "We have no intention of bringing back our old and heinous history. Your entire party is based on that."
  121. ‚Ä¶.ughhhhh pretty sure the the last time Germany voted for fascist policies, we kinda had a world war about it.
  122. Thank you Germany!
  123. I really wonder what these retards would say if you asked them if and when Hitler and the nazi party should have been stopped. Like, they did kind of win the election, they were a popular party, so I guess all they did was fair game, right...? Or ask half of them at what point a communist party should be stopped and compare the results, hahahaha!
  124. As an American, I‚Äôm ashamed of my own government. I can‚Äôt believe that my nation as a country is so stupid we let people like this get into power.
  125. 90% sure Marco used Chatgpt for that post. Chatgpt loves overuse of ----
  126. Physician, heal thyself.
  127. To his MF face!!!
  128. Little Marco !
  129. Wait what. Did they officially say that rightwing extremism must be stopped after labelling AFD as a rightwing extremist party? In other words, AFD must be stopped?
  130. What is up with the right fascist strict border crap? Like it‚Äôs all just people. People in Mexico, Germany, etc. it‚Äôs not like each country is some secluded zoo keeping animals apart and if you a monkey wants to live with the giraffes you gotta get a permit‚Ä¶we‚Äôre people. Why treat our borders like zoo enclosures. It‚Äôs so damn stupid.
  131. like giving gold to pigs
  132. Nazis defending Nazis. Lil Marco just parrots what daddy donny wants
  133. I don't disagree with Rubio or Germany. Both sides are right.
  134. You should be not tolerant to fascism
  135. "Independent courts will have the final say"

Legal courts simply enterpret the law, which is made by the politicians.

Unless the german constitution has prohibitions against arbitrarily illegalizing opposition parties (which it may have, I know fuck all about german legislation), then the reply makes no sense, as the politicians could simply make AfD illegal by law, and then the courts would be forced to rule the party illegal.

Any german who can specify the above? Does your consitution prohibit your politicians from arbitrarily illegalizing political parties?
  136. The last time the federal government of Germany will say anything against the fascist regime in USA.
  137. Occupe-toi de tes propres affaires, Rubio, et garde tes le√ßons inappropri√©es pour toi-m√™me ou ton mentor.
  138. What‚Äôs worse is it‚Äôs clearly  written with ChatGPT. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not x ‚Äî it‚Äôs y‚Äù is clearly AI. Can‚Äôt even be arsed to type out their bullshit anymore.
  139. As if the US doesn‚Äôt explicitly spy on its citizens
  140. I like when they are called on their bullshit
  141. AfD is not the real problem when the protesters against them are some monstrosities, has anyone looked at the counter-protests first rolls, it‚Äôs not humans, it‚Äôs some brainwashed monstrosities. Germany feels as a failed state and its supposed to be the leader of the EU.
  142. About as democratic as North Korea. Everybody knows the institutions were ordered what to do, be it indirectly or directly.
  143. Why are they lecturing us about democracy when they claim it is bad because of "tyranny of the majority"? 

Also, they claim they are a "constitutional republic, not a democracy", so why are they butt hurt in the first place?
  144. the USA are learning this lesson just now.
  145. But left wing extremism doesn‚Äôt need to be stopped???
  146. As if americans could have high moral values when they swim in double standards, corruption and anti democratic practices.
  147. Unlike the USA judges dont have a political affiliation there
  148. Honestly? I agree with him but surely this could've been worded better.
  149. And now with Trumps latest, they are even fighting the "propaganda" from foreign countries by imposing tariffs on those film/series productions. Telling us we are against free speech, but at the same time restricting the free flow of ideas in their own country. Pure fascism... Simple as that.
  150. Germany, getting it wrong time after time
  151. All countries should learn from this. Democracy needs to be protected as simple as that!üëèüëèüëèüëè Germany üá©üá™
  152. The control to not end that tweet with "it's time you start learning from the past too." They are a better person than me.
  153. DID HE REALLY USE CHATGPT
  154. Huge "Bundesau√üenministerium" W
  155. Shoulda been "We have learnt from Your history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped." LMAOOO
  156. What's worrying is that Rubio is the sensible one in the current usa administration. He even he is out there lying what hope is there with the other crackpots.

Oh and secretary rubio, you might want to check what your president is proposing about the DoJ before critiquing one of the most stable democracies in the world.
  157. He is right, this organisation in under the leading party by design and they instrumentalize it. Its a joke, really..
  158. They didn't give him a lesson in anything. What Rubio says is 100% true and the German Foreign Office in no way refuted it.
  159. That guy gives me henry Ford vibes. The only thing missing is a German Nazi politician taking him as a role model.¬†
But fortunately, unlike in the Third Reich, there are no rich bastards in America who finance right-wing extremist groups. Otherwise it might end up like it did a century ago. Thank God

=== POST #32 ===
**Title:** Spain and Portugal suffer a massive power outage
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 23271
**Comments (169):**
  1. Is the entierty of Iberia outta power or just areas near each others borders?
  2. I really chose the best time to take the elevator, didn't I?
Edit: as mentioned in the comment below, everything is fine now, thanks!
  3. Confirmed in Lisbon, Portugal.
  4. I have a friend stuck in an elevator and two other friends stuck on the subway. It‚Äôs kind of scary.

Edit: I‚Äôm alive and my friends are doing well as well. I lost power at midday, my phone data stopped working at 2pm and it just came back now at 9pm. What a day‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs been a bit of a nightmare. The world was a mess during Covid but at least we had power and wifi.
  5. The causes are unknown for now

Link to Euronews article: https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/28/spain-portugal-and-parts-of-france-hit-by-massive-power-outage

Edit: after 2 hours without electricity, I recovered it now. Seems like some regions in Spain are getting power back. Rumor says it was caused by a cyber attack. There is a meeting of authorities in the next few minutes, we will get clarity about the causes in the following hours.

Update 3: after about an hour with electricity, power is down again. The director of Red El√©ctrica said it could take between six and ten hours to restore electricity in all Spain. It is a gradual process.

Update 4: after 6+ hours without Internet and electricity, though luckily I could use a generator for a few hours, power is restored. About 50% of electricity has been restored in Spain, but that process is asymmetric geographically speaking.

Update 5: Well it has been officially denied that there was a cyber attack. It is practically confirmed by now that the massive outage was caused by the grid not being sufficient to handle so much energy generation caused by renewables. Renewables are expanding at a much higher pace than the expansion of the capacity of the electric network to handle it. So you could say we are a victim of our own success. There are plans to expand the capacity of the grid in 2026, so in the meantime either more blackouts could happen or we will have to disconnect some renewables or other power generators.
  6. North of portugal is blackout. What‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶
  7. A quote from the BBC seems like a joke in this thread about the brittish:

"In the Spanish resort of Benidorm, Mark England tells us how the lack of power has disrupted his holiday.

Worst of all, at a holiday destination like Benidorm, Mark says bars are unable to serve drinks because of a lack of power to their pumps.

If you haven‚Äôt got a drink, you are out of luck, he says."
  8. Thats why I had 3 people instantly disconnect at the same time in my ranked game on League
  9. We have power in the Azores :D
  10. This is one of those moments to remind us how something so simple as power loss can generate chaos in an instant.
  11. I'm stuck in Lisbon metro
  12. We should have a super thread for this.
  13. Stations Porto and Aignan show offline on Gridradar: https://gridradar.net/de/wide-area-monitoring-system

There was a sudden drop in frequency down to 49.843 Hz at 12:34. I assume a netsplit happend and at least parts of the hispanic peninsula are not connected to the rest of continental europe as of now.

To anyone assuming it's the Russians... stay calm. We've had a couple of netsplits in Europe in the past and it never was russians, but often incompetence (or accidents, thanks u/Rucks_74)
  14. Confirmed in M√°laga, Spain
  15. It has been restored here. Internet and power works normally again.
  16. Portugal grid operator e-redes website is also offline.

https://www.e-redes.pt/
  17. Here in Northern Spain we are slowly getting power back after a couple of hours. I have to admit I thought I would be ready for something like this but this was terrifying. Communications were down and I couldn‚Äôt reach out to anybody, I had to drive home from work without traffic lights‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt even know the extent of this, in the radio they were reporting outages all over Spain and Portugal but even the radio hosts didn‚Äôt really know what was going on and if anywhere else in Europe was affected. Lessons learned: Buy a battery powered radio and always have some cash stored in case of an emergency.
  18. Ah, the wonders of remote work

Sorry Boss, I'm on holiday today üòé
  19. Liechtenstein did it. They‚Äôve been hiding in the shadows all this time.
  20. "Multiple **Spanish** media are carrying quotes from a senior director at Spanish grid operator **Red El√©ctrica** saying it **could take ‚Äúbetween six and ten‚Äù hours to restore energy across the country**, as he calls it an unprecedented incident.

Eduardo Prieto, director of operations at Red El√©ctrica, declined to comment on the causes of the outage."

  21. Confirmed in Castelo Branco, Portugal
  22. Lisbon area is also blacked out.
  23. My bad guys I just connected the Washing Machine and the Oven at the same time.
  24. I have to eat without YouTube üò≠
  25. Somebody, somewhere in Spain or Portugal, has just had their brand new home solar installation completed and switched on. Just as they switched it on, the whole nation's power grid went down. Can you imagine the WTF moment they're having... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
  26. I just got my electricity back. North of Navarra

Edit: While I have had electricity at my place for a couple of hours now I just visited my dad's place in the same town and he still didn't have it. Our village seems to be split in two with the southern half having electricity and the northern part not.
  27. I was in the middle of an emergency project at work, and guess where the person I need to finish it lives üòÇ
  28. I'm in Catalonia and the worst part was not the power itself but the mobile networks going down too. Seems to have finally returned just now. I was just speaking to family members in Portugal and apparently they didn't have a mobile network failure like we did here in Spain and were still able to call each other. Maybe better generators or less population density not using as much power
  29. As Ukrainian leaving in Spain, i‚Äôve got some massive flashbacksü§£
  30. It's crazy to see the amount of people coming on this thread and spouting misinformation.

No, no official said it was Russia

No, the Portuguese government didn't ask Musk for help

No, Denmark or Italy aren't affected
  31. T√° tudo fodido
  32. I am in a critical facility and gasoil generators give us energy. For some reason I still have mobile data.
  33. I know we live in some dark times, but cmon, doesn't need to be literal...
  34. People are "stuck" inside lisbon's subway, also multiple reports of people stuck inside elevators.

Hospitals are currently on backup generators and even the traffic lights are off, kinda chaotic to drive in some areas
  35. Confirmed in Valencian Community, Spain as well
  36. It‚Äôs probably just in the Iberian Peninsula, we‚Äôre an ‚Äúenergy island‚Äù with little to no connections to Europe grid
  37. Holy shit right wing online are wasting no time instantly blaming this on renewable energy and Greta Thunberg
  38. Whether this an accident or an attack there must be some serious lack of redundancy if you can knock out that much in one go.
  39. In Croatia, we had a huge power outage last year. It affected southern part of Croatia, all of Montenegro and most of Albania. Turned out there was a fire on a power supply network...
  40. Portuguese Power says loss of power

"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'"

Whaetver the fuck that means, sounds like the type of thing IT guys say to non technical management.
  41. Barcelona here. Light just came back roughly 10 minutes ago.
  42. Ukraine here.After shelling we always lost electricity.One winter in 2022-2023 my city was in full blackout.We use to it.Now people have power station,solar panel,optic internet (we connect it to powerbank and router and have internet 5-10 hours).If we need work from laptop,we charge this in power station like ecoflo. Also we have many charges zone in schools,market, pizzeria,gym,where people can charge gadgets,work.
  43. Confirmed in the portuguese cities of Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, Guarda, Leiria, Famalic√£o. Cellphone network is still working, tho it's quite slow, probably because of everyone overloading it with mobile data.

At least the radio is working, and it's a wonderful day outside.
  44. Just come back on here in M√°laga
  45. The amount of new accounts spreading fake information here is insane üòÇüòÇ
  46. I'm around the center of Spain and we just got our electricity back minutes ago.

News are reporting that it seems that it was NOT a cyberattack but they are still investigating.
  47. South spainis blackout, not even traffic lights
  48. We have power again in the north of Spain
  49. Loss over the entire Iberian peninsula is fucking nuts.
  50. Basque Country, light back since an hour ago. Mobile phone network still not working properly but the wifi works great
  51. electricity is back in Coimbra
  52. For now I'm lucky that we have solar panels and everything is working fine. Otherwise, it would really suck.
  53. Step one of Andorra's invasion masterplan. I tried to warn, and they called me paranoid...
  54. Wild speculation: According to the schedule, quite a lot of electricity (about 3 GW) should be exported from Spain to France. Approximately at the time in question a nuclear power plant (1.3 GW) in southern France failed according to this UMM. [Production Unavailability](https://iip.cloud-rte-france.com/production-unavailability/EDF-05470_EDF_T_00217455)

Then even more power could have flowed from ES to FR and overloaded an interconnector. It fails, suddenly very high frequency in Spain, which results in emergency shutdowns and missing operational reserve. Spain was definitely exporting, which explains the frequency drop of 0.2 Hz in the rest of Europe with the split system.

Commercial export of ES to FR was also close to the technical limit during the period in question: [Commercial capacities of exchanges by order after technical constraints | OMIE](https://www.omie.es/en/market-results/daily/daily-market/commercial-capacities-constraints?scope=daily&date=2025-04-28)

EDIT: EDF released a statement that the Golfech nuclear power plant tripped at around 12:30, before or after the blackout event is unknown: [D√©connexion du r√©seau √©lectrique de l'unit√© de production n¬∞1 - 28/04/2025 | EDF FR](https://www.edf.fr/la-centrale-nucleaire-de-golfech/les-actualites-de-la-centrale-nucleaire-de-golfech/deconnexion-du-reseau-electrique-de-l-unite-de-production-ndeg1)
  55. Lived through the blackout of the Eastern USA and Canada in the early aughts. 9/10 it‚Äôs that something broke. Stay calm if you‚Äôre safe and be patient.
  56. Same in south Portugal
  57. GL to our Spanish and Portuguese friends, hope it will be resolved quickly üôè
  58. We‚Äôre back online in Getxo, Vizcaya.
  59. Salamanca, Spain. Light is back¬†
  60. Can confirm, no power right now in Portugal
  61. In Porto, Lisbon no energy either. I'm talking with my family from Spain and both Madrid and Granada are without energy.
  62. No mobile internet for some half an hour too.


It's bad. I don't remember something like this happening.
  63. Spain's grid operator, Red Electrica, says it could take up to 10 hours to restore power.¬†

Restoration depends on multiple factors, it says, but simulations indicate it could take between six and 10 hours.¬†

It also said it would not speculate as to the cause of the incident.¬†
  64. I just got power back in Salamanca, Spain.
We have been powerless for 3 hours, we could not even buy food because everything had to close Up.
Scary stuff
  65. Confirmed in the east of Andaluc√≠a. Mobile data just came back full power in my town after being down for about an hour. All FM frequencies around here are being forwarded to the same one news station, hahah.
  66. They will know with certainty what caused it. There is too many relays and devices monitoring the system for them not to know. It‚Äôll just take a day or 2 for engineers to figure it out. I do protection and control for the power company.
  67. My place of work had no power save for the computers and internet which had generators so I kept working and in my break I went to the supermarket next door and people were already panic buying üò´. Like rows of people with shopping carts overflowing with stuff. An hour later the power came back on.....
  68. Shit, was wild reading about it at work. Looking forward to the investigation and how this all happened. Some lessons to be learned for sure..
  69. Spent my day (in Lisbon) with a vintage radio on, from 11:30 until 21:30. Crazy day indeed.
  70. In northern Spain, no electricity. It has been 30 minutes already
  71. The entire peninsula down seems crazy? Is there a single point of failure that could cause this?
  72. Confirmed in Coimbra, Portugal
  73. We're now hearing from REN, Portugal's grid operator.

It claims the outage that's affected Portugal was caused by a fault in the Spanish electricity grid, related to a "rare atmospheric phenomenon". 

REN says that, due to extreme temperature variations in Spain, there were "anomalous oscillations" in very high-voltage lines.
It says this is known as "induced atmospheric variation", which in turn led to oscillations which caused synchronisation failures between systems.

That led to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network, it adds. 

It also says that given the complexity of the issue, it could take up to a week for the network to fully normalise again.
  74. [https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/28/spain-portugal-and-parts-of-france-hit-by-massive-power-outage](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/28/spain-portugal-and-parts-of-france-hit-by-massive-power-outage)  
"A fire in the south-west of France, on the Alaric mountain, which damaged a high-voltage power line between Perpignan and eastern Narbonne, has also been identified as a possible cause."
  75. Maybe I should consider buying another powerbank or two. Just in case.
  76. Real time European Grid view:

https://gridradar.net/en/wide-area-monitoring-system
  77. That damn squirrel again.
  78. south spain, still black after 3 hours
  79. Im in Portugal,got Power at 18h
  80. I was on the road for a 3 hr drive when the blackout hit. Noticed it when I couldn't get through a toll at first. Then another toll had the same problem. Then I looked at my phone and saw a message from a friend saying electricity was down in Valencia, Murcia and Barcelona. I opened another message from someone and it said all Spain was down. That was enough already to have me concerned. I tried to get petrol and was told they couldn't pump it or take payment, and that Portugal was down as well, and that it was a cyber attack. Then tried another gas station and they said France was down too, and a woman was freaking out saying it's war. Couldn't call anyone, send or receive any messages at this point.


Was some really dystopian shit, I also noticed the wind turbines weren't moving which added to the freakiness. Just barely had enough fuel to get back. Got power back 9 hrs after it started and internet just a half hour ago. Crazy day.
  81. What a surreal day. I went to sleep before midnight and there was still no power (I'm in the Algarve). The only way I could understand what was going on was by listening to the radio in my car. Fortunately my family and friends are all ok, but this just shows how little prepared many of us for these kinds of scenarios. I at least had a lot of tinned and preserved foods as well as bottles of water, but I feel like this was a wake-up call for me to stock up on some other emergency items.
  82. This must be fixed immediately or I'll have to get involved.
  83. BBC news: Reports of widespread power cuts in Spain and Portugal

[https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c9wpq8xrvd9t?post=asset%3A81ef5595-dab1-420e-a8e5-647e368183d3#post](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c9wpq8xrvd9t?post=asset%3A81ef5595-dab1-420e-a8e5-647e368183d3#post)
  84. Galicia area is out, but my computer, at work is still going... Fuckin power generators! üòÇ
  85. With power not comming back on for hours, prepare for nightfall. Batteries, camp cooker\lamp, torch, get ice if you have a cooler to keep it in. Prepare like you are going camping. Keep your fridge\freeze closed so it keeps cooler longer. Could be looting in the city centres so stay home and stay safe.
  86. living in madrid here, power/internet just came back after 7 hours. To be honest it‚Äôs been a pretty interesting day, we are not a functional living being without electricity üòÇ
  87. I'm from Asturias, north Spain. Been without power since 12:30, it just came back
  88. I just now recovered the electricity more than 10 hours without electricity.
  89. Feels weird to come back online and see that everyone is talking about us
  90. Porto is in the dark
  91. Live in Norway. Realized i don't have candles or even a flash light in my apartment. I'm hungover, but scared enough to go buy it in case it happens here. I'm scared
  92. Rumours that also happened in France. Can anyone confirm?
  93. Calm down, it's just the new Mandatory Siesta coming into force. Power will resume at 15:00.
  94. Ha, that explains why my Spanish client has not showed up to our online meeting. Amazing what you can learn through Reddit
  95. Hope everyone is alright! It‚Äôs a bit alarming to think of effects on hospitals and the like‚Ä¶
  96. How many power stations have to go down at the same time for something like this. Surely the entirity of Iberia cannot be powered from just 1 source?
  97. Still in the dark in Madrid After 2:30h. It is insane how much we depend on electricity whole city is a mess
  98. There is an update from Portugal's power firm Rede Eletrica Nacional. REN claims that the power failure was due to "extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain" causing "induced atmospheric vibration." They also say that fully restoring power in Portugal could take up to a week:

> Due to the complexity of the phenomenon and the need to rebalance electricity flows internationally, it is estimated that full normalisation of the network could take up to a week.

This is in contrast to the director of Spain's electricity network, who said that restoring power could take between six and 10 hours. There are also some reports in this thread of power having come back in the Basque region. In short, there is still a lot of uncertainty, which is not unsurprising given that this appears to be a highly unusual event. At least nothing so far points towards a Russian attack and it is therefore unlikely that other European countries outside of the Iberian peninsula will be affected.

The source for the above is BBC's live coverage: https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c9wpq8xrvd9t
  99. We got power back in the north of Portugal
  100. This is downright scary. I hope it was just a genuine accident.
  101. This is scary. A large net like that isnt that easily restarted
  103. No power in Coimbra. If this was a massive cyber attack than this is a real escalation though. Russia needs to chill the fuck out. Maybe this is a grid thing or something though. We will see
  104. In portugal and spain is down people from a spanish project and we in portugal are both without energy
  105. Here in Tenerife all good.
  106. Could it be someone checking out what happens if they drop an adversary's grid to check on their response?

Just like cutting undersea cables.
  107. Confirmed from Sevilla, cell phone towers apparently still have power but everything else is dead
  108. Had the same happen in february when I was visiting Chile. Almost the entire country (20m people) had a blackout. Over time one Internet provider after another shut down as well so the only source of information were car radios. It went on for about 7 hours. For security reasons the government issued a curfew starting at 10pm fearing riots and violence on the streets.¬†¬†
It was very weird driving around Santiago in almost complete darkness seeing only black nothing where usually you see high-rises.¬†¬†


At 11pm power returned and honestly everyone took it very well. ~~Apparently some trees in the north of the country fell on a power line and caused it~~. Scary to think how easy such an important system of infrastructure can be interrupted for a whole country.¬†
  109. Sitting in Atlanta waiting for a meeting with a coworker in Madrid, wondering where she was until I opened my phone lol. 

I guess we'll just have to discuss this project later.
  110. I have power now here in valencia Spain
  111. Portugal can have a shitty government but one thing I can say for sure, I love the people here. After the electricity came back even fireworks were launched everywhere. 

Happy new year guys!
  112. Just got power back an hour ago Andalusia
  113. I went to sleep without any power at 1AM, I think we got it back at 4AM, as long as I understand. It was a pretty peaceful day though, I live in a town in Galicia and people were just out, chilling and talking about the blackout. We were worried about people getting stuck in elevators, so we "scan" the buildings and look for people who might got stuck. No issues in public medical centers because of generators working.

It made me think about the dependency on electricity though. I mean, it's obvious, but it's more clear once you live a long blackout and things you do without thinking, are just not possible. Things like "gonna make myself some coffee", "gonna ring the bell of my neighbor to ask if he needs something", etc.
  114. If a whole region is without power, how is the internet still working? Are all the people posting "I am affected" using Starlink?
  115. Why is the Spanish media reporting that there‚Äôs also power outages in Germany and the Netherlands, when that‚Äôs absolutely not the case?
  116. I work in a kind of government institution and our engineer told us that its a very serious outage and it will not be fixed soon
  117. The alien invasion has begun?
  118. Spain and Portugal out here doing the world's first joint medieval cosplay event üòÇ
  119. well i have energy so far,  but i have a no brake system in my office
  120. I‚Äôm hearing same from people in three parts of mainland Spain ‚Äî power flickered off briefly for a min or so and simultaneously earlier and then an hour later or so went out.

(First flicker off was at 12:35 CET)
  121. Barcelona here, no power.
  122. I could talk with my girlfriend in Valencia she could use an other EU sim card, but the spanish was not working now also that is off, probalby the towers got into their own generators, some have, but eventually that will run out also, andbc of the panic all people are on the phone and now the already weak network of phone service is just overloaded
  123. Hearing reports it‚Äôs gradually being restored.
  124. I hope the people were safe.
  125. Out of interest is domestic solar power a big thing on the Iberian peninsula? It's growing in popularity in the UK in spite of our comparatively lower amount of sunlight.
  126. My mother was supposed to be having dental surgery right about now, but thankfuly the outage happened before she went to the clinic.
  127. Some electricity up in Malaga now [https://gridradar.net/en/wide-area-monitoring-system](https://gridradar.net/en/wide-area-monitoring-system)
  128. My messages for the past hour to my gf in Barcelona haven‚Äôt been delivering ‚Ä¶ cell towers are down too if the power is out ?
  129. 14:52, portugal time, still no power
  130. Still no power in the center of Portugal its 2:53 here
  131. Here on Rafelbu√±ol, Valencia we got it back right now
  132. Marc Elsberg's *Blackout* might be a popular book again at this speed.
  133. I live in Gracia, Barcelona and it's still without power. My friends living in other areas a little more central are saying it's coming back in areas. 

Hoping before it gets dark they'll sort it!
  134. I just got power and data back after the whole day without... what the fuck.
  135. tfw homes in front of my street have electricity but not the ones on our side
  137. Landed in Barca at lunch time, spent about 2 hrs driving through the city in chaos. No traffic lights, no gos. Shit show.
  138. I just got power back, and internet and cellular connection. Been in total darkness since this morning.
  139. Porto, Portugal,  we already have energy but many places in the countries are still black
  140. I predict that Spain and Portugal will experience a massive baby boom exactly nine months from today.
  141. Just got power now. Center Portugal.  It really is a eye opener of how dependent we are on electricity providers.
  142. Power came on an hour ago and just got mobile signal here in SE Spain. 

We were lucky to be at home, have some charcoal for the barbecue, and some food in the fridge. Unscheduled day off and barbecue for us üòÇ
  143. The outage took many of US remote-working. Many neighbours were on the streets asking what's going on, but the overall reaction was one of calm tension, not panic. What surprised me the most was the perfect behaviour of drivers in a big city without any traffic light working.

All shops and supermarket took the decision to close after midday. Most of the hospitals kept working and schools as well (except universities). We followed-up everything through the radio. Worst moments happened at commutes, subways and elevators, but seems things were managed. The main challenge now is to learn about the cause (I have my opinion, but don't want to speculate).
  144. On the side note, just in case of situations like this, every mobile phone should have a net-free FM radio. 

When the servers and cell towers are down due to power outage, a few FM radio towers and stations can be powered by generators. This is the only way to convey news and situation awareness.

Crazy thing is that quite many mobile phones do have FM chip already, because it's cheap and in many cases already designed and printed on circuit board. However, in most phones it's disabled because network operators want people to use paid boadband. 

EU does lot's of regulation, some of which is pretty stupid, but here they could really require every mobile phone to have an FM radio for emergency situations.
  145. Only thing I realized yesterday is how much cash is king. It was fun tho. Later at night the neighboors made a fire outside with some chicken, and people were singing and vibing... then at 23:28 it came back and it was a party. Also, because the servers are screwed, there is no Uni today. Nice experiences! lol
  146. The radio broadcast that we heard yesterday said that last time this happened in Spain, it took them 10 months to figure out why. Let‚Äôs hope it doesn‚Äôt take quite as long this time.
  147. Electricity is back almost 90% of the infrastructure is receiving electricity.

The blackout happened because an instant drop of almost 70% 
of the power.

In the first moment the spanish intelligence service (CNI) said that their best hipothesis was a ciberattack.

As of now, we still don't know what happened to make most of the grid go out of power out of nowhere. 

Even though the institutions keep everyone informed as much as they can about useful things, they are not saying why this happening, probably don't know yet, and they are not sharing many hypothesis.

Journalists are saying cyberattack, or maybe some natural phenomenon that made several catastrophic failures.

All power plants including nuclear ones and refineries activated suddenly the safety measures and there wasn't any risk.

Most problems was for citizens in trains or elevatora. Only 300 flights of 6k were delayed.

To whoever that knows a big how a grid system works specially the iberic one. Is an.engineering work full of redundant security measures, in a way that is almost impossible for it to be entirely shutdown so fast.

Also we have to be grateful for the world we live in. Spain and Portugal had been more than 12 hours without power and therefore without any possibility to defend themselves of an attack from another nation. However France and Morocco were helping restore the energy. People were not rioting, just enjoying a day of sun peacefully
  148. Well. I highly doubt you got Russian nukes incoming. I bet that the reason is the overproduction of RES sources and the TSOs' failure to curtail them.
  149. Please, don't make me go outside and socialize.
  150. JD Vance probably spoke to the electric line.
  151. Rightly or wrongly, my suspicion instantly turns to Russia. Stay safe people.
  152. it would be such a shame if everyobdy started spamming the idiotic editors from BBC with miniscule , irrelevant issues that they seem so eager to put out in [this live coverage](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c9wpq8xrvd9t).

because people not having beer on their vacation, hairdressers leaving them with just half the haircut, teaching in the dark  (at NOON IN SPAIN), and waiting for signal before you go outside to enjoy a drink are the main problems people faced according to them.  (cant post images of exact stories, look through the timeline in the article)

almost no mention of trafic, little to none about hospitals, refrigerators...
  153. I'm going to cross post my request for open petrol stations in r/Murcia here because maybe someone might be able to help! 

Hello everyone,

I am an Irish person visiting Murcia for the day from Mojacar. We got to Murcia at around 12pm and we're going to get petrol after some shopping but the power went and we have no petrol to get home. Are there any petrol stations open within 5-10km of IKEA Murcia that we could get some petrol? All the ones we've passed have been closed. 

Thank you for your help
  154. Confirmed in Valencia
  155. Mallorca is ok
  156. Confirmed in Galicia, Spain.
  157. I can confirm, I have colleagues from both Spain and Portugal and they are experiencing this. GSM network is down, airports, subway etc
  158. Confirmed in Braga
  159. In Zurich. Power is on here.
  160. Andorra is also affected, maybe Gibraltar as well
  161. Zero Day, someone call De Niro
  162. Galicia still out
  163. Some news channel in Portugal (CMTV) told that the government will talk about this but also the energy is going to be back in 3h
  164. There's going to come a point when critical systems are moved back to manual and physical control.¬†


Remote monitoring is great but it needs to be air gapped from system that can actually shut things off.
  165. Time to set up off grid solar power system boys..
  167. Still no power in the north of Portugal
  168. Good thing I'm going tomorrow. Fml
  169. In Madrid there is still no electricity yet

=== POST #33 ===
**Title:** Putin‚Äôs peace talks negotiator claimed Russians have extra chromosome
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 22435
**Comments (200):**
  1. Thread locked because a lot of you guys are being worse than Vladimir Medinsky.

Chill, guys.
  3. Lol  what‚Äôs happening real news is  indistinguishable from parody nowadays
  4. That...isn't the flex you think it is, guys.¬†
  5. that much is true. Weird flex but ok
  6. It's true. They also have eleven toes and two assholes on average.
  8. This is an insult to people with down syndrome
  12. Lol. Lmao even. ü§£
  14. I totally agree
  16. What a slap in the face for the people with Down syndrome.
  17. If russians are so great why is russia getting weaker as the decades go on? Is it like trump‚Äôs ‚Äòtoo much winning‚Äô idea? They‚Äôre so good, theyve got sick of succeeding?
  18. Isnt that Down syndrome?
  19. no shit
  20. Few years left until skull measuring starts.
  21. So they are just there to waste time...
  22. Russian biologist Trofim Lysenko gained Stalin's support and became a powerful figure in Soviet biology, particularly in agriculture. Lysenko's ideas promoted a theory that challenged established genetics.
  23. Do you know who have extra chromosome? People with Down sybdrome. That explains
  24. It‚Äòs probably the Z chromosome‚Ä¶. And would explain a lot of recent history
  25. I think he might be confusing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with Down's Syndrome. Only one of those two is significantly more common amongst Russians than other populations.
  26. Wait for Trump now to come out and tell us he has two more extra chromosomes, everyone says that and he is very special.
  27. That's an insult to people who have an extra chromosome.
  28. \*checks history books\* yup, can confirm
  29. So they are genetically damaged and sick?
  30. Weird flex, but ok
  31. As a German I'm reminded of the nazi "√úbermensch". Never mind, probably just a coincidence. 

/s
  32. Is someone gonna tell him¬†
  33. Make extra chromosomes great again! üí™
  34. So why then Russia wants anything from Ukraine? They want to mix their superior chromosome count with others?
  35. Tbh with the stuff that comes out of Russian propaganda, seems like they‚Äôre in the hobby of collecting them.
  36. #downwithrussia
  37. He ain't wrong...
  38. System of a down
  39. That would explain many things.
  40. Sure do.
  41. Yeah we all know
  42. Arrogance isn't a chromosome but then again with the way Russia behaves as a nation maybe they have a point.
  43. As an American, it cheers me up to see that our politicians are the nuttiest in the world.
  44. **TRISOMY** ('three bodies') means¬†: **The affected person has three copies of one of the chromosomes instead of two**. This means they have 47 chromosomes instead of 46. Down syndrome,¬†Edward syndrome¬†and Patau syndrome are the most common forms of trisomy.
  45. Vodka isn't a chromosome.
  46. We know.
  47. Down syndrome is really prevalent in russia
  48. >Mr Medinsky also earned widespread ridicule after arguing that Russians were particularly heroic and able to survive hardship because they ‚Äúhave one extra chromosome‚Äù. While it is likely that he was trying to speak figuratively, the assertion, made in 2012, prompted scorn even within Russia, with critics pointing out that having an extra chromosome is associated less with genetic superiority than with conditions such as Down‚Äôs syndrome.

So very old news about one very dumb statement
  49. That explains  why women and children, hospitals, schools, and kindergartens   are the target of the  special mission.
  50. People with the extra chromosome tend to be nice.  Russians not so much.
  51. That would explain a lot‚Ä¶
  52. Other primates have 24 chromosome pairs while human have 23. During the 1920's there was indeed a Russian "scientist" [Ilya Ivanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Ivanov) who tried to create ["humanzee"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanzee) (human-ape hybrid). Does that means he succeeded in his hybridization attempts on the contrary what is commonly considered as truth?
  53. So they have Trisomy (which includes Down Syndrome) or Klinefelter? I wouldn‚Äôt say something that mean about Russians in general.
  54. System of a down
  55. Hoisted on his own retard.
  56. Mongol Empire?
  57. So they have Down syndrome ... Figures...
  58. Also known as "obedient peasant chromosome"
  59. Cool. Same number as monkeys and apes.
  60. I agree.
  61. That would explain some of the ongoing mental problems in the country.
  62. Yeah, the whole world can see it.
  63. Where the lie tho?
  64. ‚Äúhe is alleged to have ghostwritten a number of the Russian president‚Äôs ‚Äúacademic‚Äù articles, including his famous essay of 2021 that provided the rationale for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine the following year. It questioned Ukraine‚Äôs right to exist as a separate entity, arguing that¬†Ukrainians and Russians were one people‚Äù

Why bomb your own people?
  65. They‚Äôre all potatoes
  66. I huh...okay then.
  67. So Russians have down syndrome?
  68. Which one?
  69. Well that explains quite a bit..
  70. _Special_ Military Operation
  71. "Putin's peace talks negotiator is a historian who once claimed that Russians have an extra chromosome due to their superiority". Even nazis for fucks sake, even they had better reasoning than this
  72. Yes absolutely extra chromosome. Some maga folks and their Orange king also luckily have this
  73. Huh and all this time I thought it was just fetal alcohol syndrome.
  74. Hey, you said it, not me
  75. That actually explains a lot!
  76. His credo is very similar to Trump's:

>‚ÄúFacts don‚Äôt matter very much. Everything begins not with facts, but with interpretations. If you love your homeland, your people, then the story you write will always be positive.‚Äù

Democracy is facing a global post-truth offensive.
  77. Explains a lot, really.
  78. Special military operation for special needs people.
  79. If you have an extra chromosome, then you have Downes Syndrome.
  80. Ohhh, that's why the leaders all look like potatoes. You can't lead without the extra chromie.
  81. These people don‚Äôt science good.
  82. Yeah the stupid chromisome
  83. Lol, well that makes a lot of sense.
  84. So... are we talking Klinefelter, Jacobs, or Down's syndrome?
  85. I believe that.
  86. This is amazing. That‚Äôs why russians having been feeling so down lately
  87. not the flex they think it is
  88. Ah, now it all makes sense! I truly regret having misjudged the Russians for so long. If they really do have an extra chromosome  as Putin proudly claimed then science might finally explain a lot.

It could be Down syndrome: that would explain certain lapses in judgment. Or maybe Klinefelter syndrome: infertility, a softer voice, sparse body hair‚Ä¶ and perhaps a bit of gynecomastia.

Alternatively, it could be Patau syndrome, with its characteristic brain, heart, and facial malformations. At this point, it‚Äôs not even irony anymore  it‚Äôs just genetics
  90. You would be called a russofob not so long ago for saying this.
  91. First time Russian negotiators are being honest and realistic.¬†
  92. Lmao, yeah, Americans at least have been saying as much since the cold war about Russians, regardless of whether it's fair or not. Now they're admitting it, lmao
  93. I get it now
  94. So it's really a special operation huh
  95. i think what they mean is Trisomy 18, since people with Down syndrome would never do what they do, they like humans too much.
  96. Tell us something we already didnt know xD
  97. *And suddenly, it all made sense.*
  98. An extra chromosome is trisomy.   Down Syndrome is a type of trisomy.   May be true.   No wonder they are so happy to have a autocrat as a leader.
  99. ah yes, the Siberian White Walker Syndrome
  100. Trisomy putin
  101. So, they are all gay?
  102. Isn‚Äôt that what causes Down‚Äôs syndrome? Would explain a lot
  103. More like Potatin then I guess..
  104. I want to live in an alternate universe and timeline where Russians are simply "normal" people. A world power but whose population doesn't have messianic believes, doesn't hate and despise everybody, doesn't have nationalistic dreams from Lisbon to Vladivostok but wants to live in peace and prosperity with the rest of Europe.


Not necessarily in the EU, not even loosely associated, simply not dreaming of nuking Paris and London every morning.¬†
  105. as a Russian this is outright funny, cant believe they made such an idiot that important
  106. Trisomie 21
  107. Special needs operation¬†
  108. Instead of brains
  109. Looool! I thought the title meant he literally said that in the peace negotiations üòÇüòÇ
  110. the mythical homo sovieticus
  111. Did they also talk about the donkeys they are using in the front? Are they getting enough food? Because that's the only thing that interests me
  112. Many laughing but Russia the kind of place to play doctor to get what they want. Synthetic chromosomes carrying engineered, cognition-enhancing genes (e.g., modulated BDNF, NRG1, or CNTNAP2) might enhance function in targeted brain areas if integrated precisely and expressed under tight control.
  113. The Z chromosome
  114. BIG IF TRUE
  115. I have a son with 2 to 3 extra chromosomes. Rather than make him strong, they've made it almost impossible to keep him alive.
  116. You mean like chimpanzees ?
  117. As chromosomes are often in pairs they probably actually meant one set of chromosomes extra. So 48 instead of 46. 

That would leave Russians with the same amount as for example gorillas.   
Or (looking at flowers) Cyclamen (commonly known in English as swinebread ).
  118. When someone tells you who they are, believe them.
  119. In Soviet Russia, syndrome downs you
  120. An extra chromosome.? All this time I thought it was fetal alcohol syndrome.
  121. This is an insult to all honest people who are diagnosed with Down Syndrome.
  122. I can see that
  123. I don't think that means what *he thinks* it means ...

https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/down-syndrome.html
  124. Isn‚Äôt an extra chromosome a biological abnormality.
  125. Well that‚Äôs just an insult to people with Down‚Äôs syndrome‚Ä¶
  126. This is extremely offensive to people with Down‚Äôs syndrome.
  127. Most pertinent part of the article in regards to the title:

> Mr Medinsky also earned widespread ridicule after arguing that Russians were particularly heroic and able to survive hardship because they ‚Äúhave one extra chromosome‚Äù. While it is likely that he was trying to speak figuratively, the assertion, made in 2012, prompted scorn even within Russia, with critics pointing out that having an extra chromosome is associated less with genetic superiority than with conditions such as Down‚Äôs syndrome.

He didn't say this during the peace talks, and even Russia called out his bullshit on that remark. It looks like he's written a couple of books that are mostly filled with dumb, "Ultranationalist," as the article calls it, claims like that one. He's also the one that's been leading Russia's peace talks for... A long while now, according to the article. Most of those peace talks have been unsuccessful and continue to be. So, you know, if they wanted something to change, he'd just be replaced.

Oh, he's also one of the guys that tried to justify the Russian Invasion of Ukraine by claiming that Ukraine was just a part of Russia that the US had fooled into thinking they weren't.
  128. Russia is a terrorist state. Remeber that.
  129. For once they're telling the truth.
  130. That's not generally a healthy/good thing. That usually means Down's, Triple X in women, or Klinefelter in men. All 3 can be mild to severe, & can generally function in public, but Klinefelter men are generally sterile & have breast tissue & less muscle mass, which aren't usually brag-worthy things for these types, & none have bonuses for having the extra chromosome.
  131. Trisomy confirmed.
  132. He claims Russians are so superior they have an extra chromosome, but also manages to claim that Ukraine is ultranationalist. Craaaazy
  133. This ‚Ä¶ this is a self-insult. And not one of the smart kinds ‚Ä¶
  134. Wait‚Ä¶he said that like it's something good that makes they better?
  135. That's not um...that's not...I mean, it's not a flex.
  136. Russians all have Kleinfelter‚Äôs XXY? That is a defect.
  137. *Vladimir Putin‚Äôs chief delegate at peace talks with Ukraine is a historian who once claimed that Russians have an extra chromosome due to their superiority.*

uh...i dont think thats how it works
  138. Nobody is going to refute that. Good of them to admit it.
  139. This explains a lot.
  140. Who‚Äôs gonna tell him?
  141. they are down with the syndrome.
  142. everything is the onion now
  143. Smartest individual russian right there
  144. Down syndrome, up syndrome
  145. That explains a lot actually.
  146. Cool! According to Putin‚Äôs peace talks negotiator, they all have Klinefelter‚Äôs just like me!
  147. i remember thinking that would be neat when first learning about chromosomes. then i learned the importance of chromosome count, in the same lesson. womp womp.
  148. Is it the 'Z' chromosome?
  149. Ok, that doesn't make you special or superior at all, but, ok
  150. Omg I pray this is true
  151. BBBBAAAAAHHHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  üòÇü§£
  152. Who are the nazis already ?
  153. maybe that extra chromosome makes them so tiny. like the tiny green men that appear whenever russia isnt doing something shady, or putin, tiny man.
  154. He might be on to something
  155. That... would explain a lot, actually...
  156. I mean‚Ä¶ he might be on to something here
  157. Yeah, called "Stupidin"...
  158. I think I'll let the Russians have this one
  159. Weird flex, but OK. üëç¬†
  160. Vodka + Extra chromosomes are a bad mix.
  161. I knew there was a reason.
  162. If they do, it's hardly an improvement.
  163. Fascinating how people manage to turn a statement made 13 years ago into something newsworthy. I guess it's might be relevant to know how much of an moron this guy is, but someone being a moron will not dissuade Trump (might be the opposite), and that's what currently matters.
  164. Yeah, that makes sense...
  165. The Russian leadership definitely does.
  166. i believe it
  167. So to be russian is a new gender or what do they wanna tell us with that?
  168. ü§£
  169. So that's what he meant by Special Military Operation
  170. Chrommunism
  171. Hahaha
  172. Chinese officials say this type of thing as well. No wonder
  173. Yes that makes them absolutely stupid for following a sick man to war.
  174. They are very special indeed.
  175. Your aware thats a bad thing right.
  176. The V chromosome for (vodka)?
  177. That would explain a lot.
  178. .....

  
.......... so down's syndrome? Is there another way to read this?
  179. What
  180. Down with this sort of thing.
  181. Special forces
  182. Wot?
  183. Can't read the article behind the paywall. Did he say that again lol? I know he claimed that in 2013 (and it is one of reasons why he's widely known as a clown here)
  184. Yeah, weird flex ya fuckin mutants... ü§£
  185. I guess a population-wide gene defect would explain quite a lot about recent Russian actions.
  186. I instantly believe him
  187. ooga... booga... ü¶ß
  188. Special my ass...
  189. I see they‚Äôre going with the Peter Griffin defense now

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb9dV_DP5NI
  190. What a nubes.. still trying to be superior..hitler allover again.is that why trump likes the guy?
  191. Ye probably do
  193. it's not the flex they think it is
  194. Yep three Y chromosomes, even the women‚Ä¶ /s
  195. if true they're so superior why is their country such a shithole... a gas station parading as a country
  196. Is this an XYY man ?  I remember from way back in school that these chromosomes were often found on people in prison.

**Title:** Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan 'will be extradited to Britain'

  1. I mean not only are they a pair of rapists, they also owe a [lot of money to the UK in taxes](https://news.sky.com/story/andrew-tate-and-brother-tristan-lose-2-8m-court-case-over-unpaid-tax-claims-13275863).
  2. Let's hope that when they are sent back, they are actually dealt with.
  3. thoughts and prayers (praying they get locked up in a romanian prison for life)
  4. As this was the 3rd time Romanian prosecutors failed to get their indictment verified - I think UK will have better chances on conviction. 
However - they were to be extradited only after the Romanian trial ends. 
As the Tates now announced leaving Romania - UK should act faster. 

Also there's an indictment in Florida against them as well.
  5. Where are their chins?
  6. Starmer, all will be forgiven if you use your human rights lawyer powers for good and find a way to lock up these Groomer traffickers for the forseeable.
  7. But they fled Romania a couple of months ago?
  8. >The announcement comes after Andrew Tate posted a post the day after the presidential election saying he was leaving Romania and hinting that he was doing so because Nicu»ôor Dan had become president. In fact, he actually supported George Simion and even posted several posts to that effect. 

So they were hoping that a MAGA/Russian puppet would be elected in Romania which would work in their benefit.
  9. And please, stop them using phones and internet fast
  10. Nicu»ôor Dan working hard already.We don't need these pimps here
  11. Good, they‚Äôre our problem to deal with.

Lock em up and throw away the key.
  12. Each time a photo of them is shown in the media the less human they look. It's uncanny. They really need to be made an example of, but how that is done ethically, morally and to provide the biggest message to those who need to hear it, is a huge debate.
  13. Not good for the women of the UK.
  14. Let the cunts rot in a Romanian cell, then extradite them after they've served their time there.
Horrible bastards who are ruining some young, vulnerable men with their jurassic park thinking.
  15. I hope they will rot in jail!
  16. Jeez, how many different countries did these guys commit crimes in? Were they on some kind of sexual abuse world tour or something?
  17. Best bit about this is that it's Bedfordshire Police, so it's going to make for an amazing episode of Channel 4's '24 Hours in Police Custody'
  18. Just put them in a jail. They look like they are in a World Tour.
  19. These twins are basically a live grenade for every country they are in. Everybody involved knows that they are guilty but everybody does not want to be the guys who throw them in jail, because too many male adolescents were poisoned by this fuckers.
  20. Jesus will somebody just imprison these fuckers so we can get on with our lives?!
  21. I read it as "executed" at first and was happy for a second.
  22. Why? So he gets a lighter sentence than he would get in Romania?

They wanna do it for the optics but bro would get 1 week in jail before early release
  23. Weak men up in here lol
  24. Wooden spoon dipped in pubes on tour '25
  25. My dumb brain read executed . I really need a drink
  26. Christ, we‚Äôve gotta have these cockroaches back in our country?
  27. Let's hope the get the book thrown at them, HARD.
  28. Have them locked away and throw the key away
  29. Lock them up!
  30. keelhauling
  31. I would assume there's a 0 percent chance that Trump doesn't interfere in this.
  32. Ahh, the levels of hated towards these two pieces of runny shit. It really restores my faith in humanity.
  33. Can we put them in jail and forget about them for 40 years
  34. Hope they get what they deserve
  35. Hope they will be tried in the UK, I'm not from the UK but I'm pretty sure it will be an open court and we will finally get to know what charges are true and what are bs rumours.

If they are innocent getting tried in the UK must be a lot better than Romania, if they are guilty we sure are going to know a lot more about them
  36. So tired of these two people
  37. Happy that Birtish are taking out their garbage from Romania. They've done enough bad things here.
  39. Can‚Äôt we just blast these bozos into space at this point?
  40. Put ‚Äòem in the stocks at tower london
  41. and what happened to the charges in Romania? I sincerely hope these two are properly prosecuted and punished somewhere where there's still rule of law.
  42. Prison for life.

It‚Äôs all those despicable creatures deserve.
  43. this truly is a case of how far will money AND connections get you.
  44. I wonder if this will finally make him decide what kind of accent he wants? Jokes aside, I hope the court has a strong case so that this guy can finally face some consequences for his actions.
  45. To bellmarsh with the assholes
  46. Lock him up
  47. Keep them out
  48. Fuck why do we have to get stuck with these arseholes ?
  49. Someone execute them already

Nothing of value will be lost
  50. Could someone actually do something¬†with these criminals? Why can't we ship these idiots to el sav. Scum
  51. Well we have every other scumbag here, so im not surprised.
  52. I wonder how messed up their childhood was to end up so terrible and such waste of space.
  53. Are they wanted here?

Edit: wanted as in for crimes, I know nobody actually wants them here
  54. Reminds me of Futurama:

"The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it, not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean."
  55. I wish they were extradited to the sun in an iron ball.
  56. Get 'em, UK!!!
  57. keep them away from women
  58. Hope they'll be sent to British jail, and be served nothing but bread and wotah.
  59. Finally üëç
  60. a gangster wannabe, time to put em away
  61. So is the jig up for them?
  62. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  63. In a just world, they would have been extradited to El Salvador!
  64. Take trump too
  65. It's possible they dissepear, never seen them on the plain. Let them go up in smoke.
  66. Good riddance
  67. No thanks, we don't want them here.  Send them where they will spend a lot of time in a horrible prison.
  68. As long as these fuckers rot in jail somewhere‚Ä¶¬†
  69. can we drop them in the north sea instead
  70. Would sooner they get extradited into the fucking sun.
  71. LOL a couple of months ago I commented on the clip of a bodybuilder I follow who made content with Andrew Tate, asking why he would associate himself with a rapist. 

Not only was I repeatedly asked for friendship by both brothers and threatened, but their followers were lying about him being cleared of charges and calling names.

I am still amazed by how big of a following such a person of mediocre intelligence can get.
  72. Maybe in prison AT will finally come to accept his homosexuality, and might even start liking it there, always pretending it's an accident when he drops the soap....
  73. What goes around comes around.
  74. So they will flee to Russia now?
  75. Can they be extradited in a Boeing 737 max? Asking for research purpose.
  76. Good
  77. Andrew perpetually looks like a confused dog when you pretend to throw the tennis ball but don‚Äôt. I would think he‚Äôd have to be photographed not looking confused at least once‚Ä¶accidentally.
  78. The one thing I don‚Äôt get about this vile misogynistic scumbag is that thousands of teenagers see him as an confident Alpha male role model, but all I see is a deeply insecure man who thinks that shouting as loud as possible to every question put to him gives him strength and maturity. Mature and grounded individuals tend to be quiet, considered and thoughtful, the last person in the world I would look up to is someone who screams and shouts all day long.
  79. Dear Britain, please burn both of these piles of trash.  Thanks very much.

 \-A Concerned Father in USA
  80. We won't miss them (although they were entertaining at times tbh)
  81. Reddit is the epitome of teenagers brain.
  82. Lets fucking gooooooo!!!

Edit: I'm happy cuz I think UK can do a better job at punishing them. Romania dropped the ball when it allowed them back to USA
  83. If they're put in prison, they can be sent literally anywhere else.
  84. We don't want them.
  85. no ty
  86. they're sure getting around...
  87. Sending my thoughts and prayers lmfaoooooo
  88. I don‚Äôt think the U.K. wants them back. Can‚Äôt we send them to Russia or somewhere they‚Äôd be wanted?
  89. Pizza pizza!
  90. Can they be lost at sea?
  91. Fuck that. We dont want them.
  92. Lock them up ... throw away key.
  93. Oh hell no. We don't want them.
  94. These are Trumps friends
  95. I thought they were in the US now?
  96. Too much money being wasted on morons who don't deserve it. I don't understand these over the top displays of "justice" & "morality" that these rich fucks are getting. 

Meanwhile other "not so famous" criminals rarely get any of this.
  97. Maybe they could house him in Jimmy Savilles old house. Invite Rolf Harris and garry glitter. It would be televised. A bit like 'I'm a celebrity get me out of here' except every week an unspeakable act is carried out on them. 

 The public don't get to find out what the act was, but the following week they try to guess by reading the haunted hollow faces of the contestants, observing their diminishing persona on a week by week basis, while voting by text every Saturday.

The hosts of the show remain concerned but jovial. By season 4 the contestants have asked to be moved to a prison.
  98. Can we just extradite them like 95% of the way back to Britain?
  99. Elections have consequences
  100. Now They‚Äôre Getting Trafficked 

ü´Äüå±‚õìÔ∏è ‚ÄîÁÑ∞
  101. You know what? Just keep that lanky streak of piss.
  102. Why? We don't want them.
  103. Can we extradite them to Uranus?
  104. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  105. Sorry, I read that as executed. ¬†Time for me to get off Reddit.
  106. Why does the UK have to deal with the worst Asian people in society?
  107. It's fine, we don't want them.
  108. We don't fucking want them.
  109. Stop crying! They will be pick up by Trump from England. You will see .
  110. We don‚Äôt want them. Sorry.¬†
  111. When????
  112. honestly just ship him to austrailia
  113. Can't we extradite them to Mars

We could do that with all our problems
  114. They probably would be worshiped in Britain and asked to join the Love Island cast.
  115. How bad are the prisons there?  I‚Äôve vote for them being sent to somewhere with the worst conditions possible.
  116. Hahahaha. Romania is as likely a better option, boys.
  117. i thought they went to the US. did they go back to Romania?
  118. Hopefully they get hit by a meteor
  119. Britain going after rich tax cheats? Since when? Is this an April fools joke?
  120. Here's to hoping that plane crashes.
  121. Oh blimey, what‚Äôs this? A right sorry state‚Äî
Two baldish buffoons, it's Tristan and Tate!
They strutted like roosters, all muscles and boasts,
Now they‚Äôre headed to Britain, our jolly old coasts.

With passports revoked and their tweets full of bile,
They‚Äôre trading Bugattis for courtroom style.
From mansions abroad to a cellblock so grey,
The brothers Tate finally won't get their way.

"Top G?" More like ‚ÄúTop Git,‚Äù some say with a grin,
As they're welcomed with handcuffs and a stern British chin.
A bobbie will greet them, polite as can be:
‚ÄúRight this way, lads ‚Äî your new home‚Äôs at HMP.‚Äù

Their fans may still worship with keyboarded flair,
But the rest of us Brits? We just chuckle and stare.
No Piers Morgan standoff, no podcasting fame,
Just porridge and silence ‚Äî oh, how very tame.

Gone are the Lambos, the flexing, the flash,
They'll learn now that karma comes quicker than cash.
No cigar lounges here, just lukewarm baked beans,
And no more escape in Romanian scenes.

So here's to the justice, and crumpets and tea,
To cellmates who snore and a loo with no seat.
For all of their bluster, their arrogance great‚Äî
They couldn't outwit the long arm of the state.
  122. Haha good show! Let them try that hard man routine in Wormwood Scrubs!
  123. Sorry Britain :(
  124. As I pointed out in another thread. It takes both countries to make extradition possible. Nothing to see here.
  125. Man the EU is just making the UK pay through the nose for this relations reset.
  126. And after the UK I believe Ireland is wanting them next.
  127. ONLY after the criminal trial in Romania, so possibly years and since they can just leave Romania if they think they are getting convicted maybe never.
  128. I'm curious hiw their finances have been looking since all this.
  129. Israel are openly boating about it

https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1924501462807089208?t=X3mPuXcVVdieiWvxXlI2vQ&s=19
  130. lol

Can‚Äôt buy a pardon from Trump there
  131. Keep your daughters safe!
  132. Stupid.
  133. *They're both going on a Summers holiday!*
  134. Ugh god. Until when? We are not short of assholes here.
  135. Achieving Trade Deals left and right, and gets to put these cunts behind bars.

May the Starmageddon never end.
  136. Can we feed them to Charlie Bronson? Is he still alive?
  137. There's something poetic about all these countries passing the Tate brothers around.
  138. No I don‚Äôt want them here üò´ aren‚Äôt they in Florida? Won‚Äôt one of the famous Florida Man‚Äôs feed them to a gator or something üêä¬†
  139. Trust me bro this time theyre surely gonna pay for their crimes, this time for sure bro dont worry
  140. Oh FFS. We don't want them.¬†
  141. Reminder the US had them and let them go because the US likes rapists under the current administration.
  142. Guess he didn‚Äôt pay Trump enough
  143. Good. Lock this two bitches up and throw away the key.
  144. Nice
  145. Hope they rot.
  146. The fact that they haven't been to charge and convict them this far is telling. I doubt that anything other than some sensationalist headlines will come of this.
  147. NGL, I really wasn't expecting this.
  148. Fuck yeah! üëç
  149. üëèüëèüëèüëè
  150. Here's hoping that they get some severe punishment. Rot in prison and become bussy, Twatrew Tato.
  151. Their chins will follow next year..
  152. This is supposed to happen  after serving the sentence in Romania. I doubt they will be in the country when the sentence is announced or that they will return to be incarcerated.
  153. Is there a way to extradite them to a British overseas territory? iirc a few of them are uninhabited
  154. That's cruel and unusual punishment.
  155. Good.
  156. Creeps.üñï
  157. Oh god... They can stay in America for all I care.
  158. Good. Make an example of them.
  159. Maybe they can take part in the chemical castration trials?
  160. Nah, they'll probably claim refugee status and be welcomed in the US with open arms complete with a Whitehouse welcome.
  161. All income is taxable.  Even criminal income
  162. oh ffs, as if it‚Äôs not bad enough i have to see their shite all over the book of faces i know get hear of all the shite they pull on the news too. 

can‚Äôt they be punished somewhere else?
  163. Kinda disappointing tbh, the UK is famous for having extremely lenient sentences so they will prob get a slap on the wrist.
  164. I don't care. They're fucking criminals, and I hope they throw the book at then because they're fucking pieces of shit; but I'm sick of having to hear about these turds. They're not fucking celebrities (or they shouldn't be). Throw the salt on the fucking snail and let's move on.
  166. was this part of the UK-EU deal? Take back the two pr*cks!
  167. OK. The Tate brothers have a right to US citizenship. So perhaps the UK could "do a Begum" and strip them of their British passport?
  168. I thought they are going to prison
  169. Isn't he in America right now? This hinges on the US sending him back and I can't see anything on either Romania or the UK talking to the US yet

Please correct me if I'm wrong though as I'm unfamiliar with how stuff like this plays out on the international stage
  170. Why these guys are famous for?

=== POST #35 ===
**Title:** On this day 161 years ago, the Russian Empire began a systematic genocide against the Circassian people. 97% of the population perished; the rest were exiled from their homeland.
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 21392
**Comments (114):**
  1. Stop reporting this. Genocide denial is against our rules.
  2. My mothers side is Circassian they used to tell me about men who sacrificed themselves so that women and kids could go on boats to escape the russians. The boats were small and could accept only so many people without having an overturn..
  3. The most disgusting thing is that generals which participated in war and organised (they were encouraging soldiers to rape and kill childern and women) genocide are not condemned, but cherished in russia to this day. Russians build monuments for them, specifically for organising genocide.
  4. Russia may have no overseas colonies like other european countries but they do act like a colonialist to their surrounding countries...
  5. One of the most reprehensible acts of Russia. 

You can find more information here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian\_genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_genocide)
  6. It's disgusting that many still deny this event. I truly have no words.
  7. Many of them lost their lives in the Blacksea so most still don‚Äôt eat fish from the Blacksea.
  8. This happed during Caucasian War and unsurprisingly this was never featured in our books, to my knowledge, from 2007-16. I doubt that federal books even mention anything civilian related.
  9. So I am geeking a lot on Russia and Circassians, so some random "funny" things about them:

Circassians had a really strong population and impact on Turkey and the Middle East following the genocide and expulsion.

1) A lot of Ottoman sultans had Circassian roots.

2) Amman, the Jordan capital, was initially founded as a Circassian settlement.

3) There is a new research highlighting how Leonardo Da Vinci's mother was likely a Circassian slave.

4) There are villages, settlements and towns across the Middle East that have still a pure Circassian character including two towns in Israel.

Now some heavy facts about the genocide.

1) Russian sources indicate that the population of Sochi, the last Circassian capital, was reduced following the genocide from about 100,000 to 96.

2) Out of the original 12 Circassian tribes, currently in Russian, only Kabardians have an established presence.

3) Similar practices took place across northern Caucasus and other ethnic groups, including Chechens and the Ingush.
  10. Expecting russian bots with their takes:
- it wasn‚Äôt genocide but rather self defence/liberation 
- it was but it was necessary 
- us/england/etc did that too at some point
  11. Russia never changes.
  12. More modern example: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation\_of\_the\_Chechens\_and\_Ingush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_the_Chechens_and_Ingush)
  13. Then 2014 Sochi Olympic village was build on the ruins of their cities, to erase it forever
  14. Let's play a game! How many sentences can you make?

On this day ___ years ago, the Russian _________ began a systematic process against _________. ______% of the population perished; the rest were exiled from their homeland.
  15. Lest we forget
  16. Ah, yes. "Russkiy mir" at its finest. ü´†
  17. Did they try to join the EU or something?

Or existed in a threatening manner like Ukraine? Perhaps they were not a real country? Did they have nazis and needed some denazifying?
  18. I'm Adyghe (Circassian) by blood and while I genuinely appreciate the valiant effort to spread awareness of the Genocide, which to this day hasn't been recognized by any state apart from Georgia, there is some misinformation going around in this thread..¬†

So a few corrections:¬†

- Around 97% were killed or exiled, around 50-50 depending on which source you look at. There's still millions of us around lol, including nearly a million in Russia proper.¬†

- The Kabardians were certainly not the "only tribe to have survived", honestly no clue where people are getting this from..¬†

- Sochi wasn't our capital city at the time, it was a small port town for trade with the Ottomans, and only became relevant after the Russian conquest.¬†


While this may seem like minor nitpicks to some, it's important to be factual when advocating for a cause and spreading information, as this otherwise plays right into the "both sides are full of shit" narrative that Russian propagandists try to spread, and does not help Circassians.¬†


On a lighter note, I'd encourage people to read about how Circassians have managed to carve out a place for themselves in exile around the Levant. Wikipedia has some great articles about us in different countries (The Jordanian royal guard being made of Circassians by tradition is probably my favorite).¬†

Here's a few links:¬†
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians_in_Jordan
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians_in_Syria
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians_in_Egypt
  19. Russia and genocide, an iconic duo.
  20. Meanwhile only Ukraine and Georgia have officially recognized Circassian genocide and for some reason EU countries dont.
  21. Russians still think they saved them.
  22. Just russia being russia, nothing new or surprising.
  23. Genocide is genocide. This one is an example of a complete success. The people were eliminated and few survivors displaced. The history was completely erased and there is almost no knowledge much less restitution or justice. This has to be the blueprint for all the other state sponsored genocides going on now.
  24. I'm European (From Lombardy) and more and more I'm learning about Europe's geography, the more I want to learn more and spread the word. I've been learning about Udmurtia, Tatarstan, Chechnya and other republics....so I decided to look for r/europe...so I'm very impressed to see there is discussion going on about Circassia (The remnant today being the Republic of Adygea and communities in Turkey, Syria and other places). Thank you for sharing.
  25. the bad thing is that they didn't kill only the Circassians
  26. The recognition of this genocide on reddit of all places makes me so happy as an ethnic Adyghe. I never see people mention us, Circassians, during discussions surrounding genocide. My mother‚Äôs grandfather was born in true Circassian lands before being forcefully exiled from his homeland. My mother still reminds me of the atrocities committed by Russians to this day. So many elements of our culture was lost. So many languages were forced to be forgotten.
  27. I am a Circassian living in Turkey and after 161 years in exile i still know my native language, cultures, dances and thankfully not assimilated despite everything.
  28. Just like they did to every other ethnic minority group. Many languages and cultures have been lost due to these genocides all over Russia.
  29. People remember the genocide of the Circassians. Its good. But don't forget that Cherkassy is only a small part of the Russian empire. Look at the whole territory from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Saratov, Tambov, Kurgan and many other regions had non-Russian population, and now there are more than 90% Russians. And it's still going on. According to the results of the last census Chuvashis have lost 30% of their population in the last 10 years
 Mari, Mordva, Komi, Tatars and many others have lost 10-30% over the last 10 years. Some may say, 'Who are these people? Other uncontacted tribes?' No, they are the same peoples as in Europe, some over a million people. I'm one of them. Maybe we haven't created the world's celebrities. But we had a cozy little world, our own culture and language. That is being destroyed now

When I wrote this post, I was looking for accurate data. I came across a post on the Russian internet and the comments almost made me throw up. There was so much hatred towards non-ethnic Russians, especially Muslims. There were even suggestions of poisoning us. We are not migrants, we live in the land of our ancestors. This is a disgusting country.
  30. So nothing has changed
  31. So this sub has decided to stop feeling bad for the Romanovs? Well it's progress I guess.
  32. And in charge of that was Georg Otto Ewald Freiherr von Sa√ü
  33. No wonder. We speak about the nation that mass-murdered its own peasants with chemical weapons in Tambov.
  34. Russia being Russia.
  36. The Russian Trail of Tears
  37. Not much has changed with Russian mentality.
  38. Some things don't change. A few centuries ago almost the entirety of modern day Western Russia was populated by Finno-Ugric peoples, these days there are only a handful left
  39. Because of this my ancestors had to move different places. They tried to find a similar place to their homeland. Now we're living in the west of Turkey but we can still speak our native language even though it's a language mixed with Turkish. I can't even imagine if they weren't able to move to a different place what would my ancestors had to endure. I don't understand why people don't acknowledge our existence. Even in Turkey, teachers always mention the Russian-Ottoman war but never the people who had to suffer with deportations. It's annoying but I know my existence is a proof of their sufferings.
  40. After the Rus shook off the yoke of the Mongol Empire, defeating them militarily at the Kalka River sometime in the 1400‚Äôs(?), one of the Ivan‚Äôs began a systematic conquer/colonize campaign that all of his descendants followed. Rus aggression is not new, the entire empire was founded on taking over the old Mongol empire.
  41. What is with Russian and their general thirst for blood ? 


They have the largest country in the world and are still hungry for more land ... 


I do hope Chinese to turn on them and f them from below ( geographically)
  42. Not much has changed with the Russian mind set...
  43. they threatened russia by planning to join NATO
  44. Typical Russian shit
  45. Meanwhile the Circassian units in the ottoman empire were among the most fearsome, responsible for many atrocities towards the christian population. I guess there may have been a revanchist √©l√©ment since they had suffered a genocide as a religious minority in their own homeland.
  46. Many of them took refuge here in Syria üá∏üáæ

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians_in_Syria
  48. Reduce Russia to Moscow
  49. Russia does what Russia does best
  50. Federation of Russia should be dissolved into its different 30 republics and territories.
  51. While horrible, it isn't 97% of the population was *killed*.  It's 97% of the population was affected either through death or displacement (and 3% remained).  The actual deaths look to be around half the population if I follow the [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_genocide) correctly.
  52. Remembering the loud people in the American far left who claimed that Russia's hands were clean of genocide and colonialism.
  53. To this day, some of my fellow Americans are able to recognize the genocidal and settler colonial roots of our own country but are completely ignorant about Russian genocidal colonialism. 

I'm referring, of course, to "tankies", or campists, who think Russia is an anti-imperial force in the world.
  54. Yay! My people get mentioned! I‚Äôve always wanted to go to Nalchik and Sochi. I remember when my grandfather brought me a beautiful traditional dress from Russia. Circassians have such a beautiful and unique culture
  55. Fuck the tsardom
  56. That is really tragic and violence is in their genes and continue to be violent today. Everyone just keep borders as is and stop hurting others, no more violence.
  57. We are so good at remembering old genocides. Do not worry, Netanyahu... We will blame you in 100 years.
  58. Those interested should look up [Grigory Zass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Zass) \- one of the commanding generals during the genocide. Not sure how this guy isn't more well known, easily one of the most sadistic men to have walked our planet.
  59. That's their thing...

don't forget about the kola norwegains stalin perished.

  60. Russian empire being the Russian empire.
  61. Around half of the population were killed, not 97%. Instead, 97% were killed or displaced.
  62. I'm looking forward to a time (that will probably never arrive) when we can discuss and debate the veracity of all these atrocities out of the sphere of politics. Clearly the concept of nation-states did a lot of harm as it established itself as the new paradigm around 19th century and we should be able to address that harm without making it a weapon in today's political arena.
  63. Another good example of the beauty of the russian world.
  64. Now this is genocide
  65. damn, next time something like this happens we should do everything in our power to stop it before it's too late üáµüá∏
  66. Uh oh, you said *the word*.  

Now those assholes will be all over this thread jerking each other off.
  67. what country are circassian people from? like in today's country?
  68. damn man... circassians are even the second biggest ethnic group in my home province
  69. I grew up in Jordan with Circassian classmates. They‚Äôre incredibly patriotic, hardworking, generous and loving people with hearts of gold. 

So loyal, in fact, that the Hashemite monarchy‚Äôs Royal Guards are always chosen from among the Circassian demographic. Been that way since the 1940s.
  70. Why does the world still put up with Russia and all of its crimes against humanity?
  71. Maybe that Lenin guy and his friends did a good thing overthrowing the Romanovs.
  72. Somebody needs to tell Europe what they did during colonization of the global South.
  73. And they're at it again in Ukraine
  74. Same scheme in RuSSia at every f..ing time in its history.
  75. Russia is build upon Genocide
  76. My ancestors suffered from this
  77. Turkey welcomed to them. They are mostly live in Turkey right now.
  78. And people wonder why we have never been visited by intelligent alien life.
  79. Partial Circassian here (of Alevi belief)

I will never forgive Russia and its current affiliates.

They all owe me and so many other people so much, it‚Äôs beyond infinity.
  80. Has anything changed since then?
  81. My greatest solidarity with the Circassian people. The people of my ancestors, the Volga Germans, faced a similar fate at the hands of the Soviets.
  82. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not at least a little mad about your country‚Äôs history, you don‚Äôt know your country‚Äôs history.‚Äú
  83. Russia is the number 1 country when it comes to genocide. No one (not even Germany) comes even close.

And yet no one knows about its horrendous atrocities against unsuspecting and totally innocent populations. Entire ethnic populations have been wiped off.

Russia should be completely disarmed and be split into 50 independent republics. Their ruling class class be held accountable for the atrocities that they have committed since the end of the Soviet Union.
  84. What is it with Russians? Belligerent, cruel, xenophobic.
  85. Russia bots are out in force.
  86. Why only dog on Russia? Why not france or britain? Or any other nations thru history? And don't forget the african countries or the asian ones
  87. It makes me sad and angry how many cultures and people have been destroyed by Russian as well as other kinds of European imperialism. Since I know from experience that even in very open-minded countries like the UK, many people don't know much about their colonial atrocities, it must be way worse in Russia.
  88. And yet no nationall government besides Georgia and Ukraine has officially recognized the genocide to date.
  89. I find it "funny" that Russia had "issues" with every single one .

Congrats from being such a shity ass country
  90. Kind of a dick move, Russia
  91. Damn
  92. To protect yourself from knowledge you should paint your face in orange
  93. As an ethnic Armenian, I feel for Circassians. Our stories share similarities.
  94. Russia must be the home of the most evil rulers in modern history.
  95. Day of morning. It's sad how the circassians has been chased from place to place. Golan Heights should have been theirs to keep.
  96. 97% both killed AND expelled. It's around 50-50 when it takes to killing or expelling
  97. I guess Genocide is just the Modus Operandi. All I know about Circassians is that there was gonna be a race in Star Trek named that. Then it turned out the Circassians were real, so the aliens were renamed to Cardassians.
  98. Hmm kinda reminds me of something similar happening today
  99. Western Europe went overseas, Russia looked inland towards central Asia and Caucasus¬†
  100. The more I learn about THESE GUYS! the more I dislike THEM!(NOT THE GENERAL POPULATION)
  101. Selective punishment. Nice
  102. Black Sea took our people forever...
  103. Was this bigger death rate than holodomor that soviet union unleashed aginst ukrainian people?
  104. the worst part is, the US is beginning to do theirs right now.
  105. The war began in 2014 with the coup government.
  106. Thanks to Turks we are still here
  107. Excited to see nitwits on this sub blame this on the Soviet Union.
  108. Nice guys, these Russians...
  109. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of killers. We‚Äôve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country‚Äôs so innocent?‚Äù-Trump‚Ä¶.btw, perfect failed opportunity of Trump to quote Kramer: ‚Äúwhat do you think junior? You think these hands have been soaking in ivory liquid?‚Äù I don‚Äôt love that Trump is calling the country he‚Äôs supposed to lead, a country ‚Äòfull of killers‚Äô.
  110. On this day Israelis and americans are doing the same and even worse yet you don't seem to do much about it.
But when the Russians do it they're monsters. Fuck your double standards.

  1. If the US embassy does not want to purchase goods or services, they can just stop doing that without informing the Swedish city planning office of the reason.
  2. They did the same in Norway where they asked the energy and utility company to pledge no DEI hiring was happening or they would not buy electricity from them. What morons
  3. Rename the three roads surrounding the embassy diversity, equality & Inclusion so it's on their address and all correspondence from them to the us gets caught in some poorly written DEI filters.
  4. I can't even begin to wrap my head around this level of arrogance and entitlement.
  5. They tried the same thing in Norway, Oslo, last week. No one is going to sign that. If they disapprove they can pack up and go home.
  6. I am surprised they haven't renamed it to US embarassy yet.
  7. Well, time to use the rezoning magic wand and rezone the US Embassy as a landfill.

  9. Easiest thing would be, for the companies that the embassy deals with, to politely say they're welcome to find other suppliers/workmen/whatever. Which should make for an interesting result. Imported loo paper, anyone?

US embassy demands obedience from Stockholm city: ‚ÄúBizarre‚Äù     
Updated 18:57 Published 16:52    
‚ÄúWe will never sign this contract‚Äù, says S-mayor Jan Valeskog.    

The Stockholm City Planning Office must not promote gender equality, diversity and inclusion. This is what the US Embassy demands in a letter, with a contract they expect the city to sign.

- ‚ÄúIt's completely bizarre,‚Äù says Jan Valeskog (S), Mayor of Stockholm.
Text Mia Tottmar

The embassy begins the letter with ‚ÄúDear City Planning Office‚Äù and then explains that a new policy requires anyone from whom the US government purchases goods and services to sign the contract.

The Department of Public Works is expected to sign and return the contract within 10 business days.

- We absolutely will not do that, it goes against everything we stand for. They should withdraw these oddities," says Jan Valeskog.

It is the embassy that benefits from the City of Stockholm, not the other way around, he believes.

- If the US terminates its relationship with the City Planning Office, the embassy will find it difficult to obtain building permits if they want to rebuild, for example. ‚ÄúThat's their headache, not ours,‚Äù says Valeskog.

According to the National Board of Housing, Building Permits are required for new construction, extensions and certain changes to the external appearance of buildings.

DN has previously reported that the USA has demanded the same of Swedish companies that supply goods and services. At the time, the embassy replied in an email to DN that ‚ÄúU.S. missions are reviewing contracts and grants to ensure they comply with the White House's latest executive order‚Äù.

Shortly after Trump was sworn in as president in January, he signed an executive order to scrap government-funded programs aimed at promoting inclusion, equality and diversity in the workplace.

  12. I heard this started when the US ambassador to Sweden was not able to assemble an IKEA side table and got real big mad.
  13. Fine. We won‚Äôt sign anything like that. So if they want to, they can build an outdoor crap house and start hauling water in buckets from the lake.

Idiots from an idiot country.
  14. Trump is bizarre and we need to impeach him and remove him from office.
  15. Are MAGAs just jealous of all first world countries, states, and counties?
  16. Kick them out then. They don't get to dictate what foreign cities and countries do.
  17. > The City Planning Office is expected to sign and return the contract within ten working days.
‚ÄúWe absolutely won‚Äôt do that ‚Äî it‚Äôs completely contrary to everything we stand for. They should withdraw this nonsense,‚Äù says Jan Valeskog.
He believes it is the embassy that benefits from the City of Stockholm, not the other way around.
‚ÄúIf the U.S. ends its relationship with the City Planning Office, the embassy will have a hard time getting a building permit if, for example, they want to renovate. That‚Äôs their problem, not ours,‚Äù says Valeskog.


lol
  18. They can stop purchasing water and electricity from Swedish companies too.
  19. Can they fuck off for once
  20. I suggest the city responds with a list of all the services that they can't guarantee aren't handled by "DEI" staff.


Water, electricity, garbage collection, and so on...
  21. With any luck the US will eventually implode in on itself and we will be free from this dogshit country once and for all
  22. Is there any US representative anywhere with enough balls and brain to not endorse and relay this kind of simpleton tantrum?
  23. Or what? What possible consequences does non compliance bring?

Are they going to stop using the city's services?

????
  24. Tell them as politely as you can to fuck off.
  25. The opposite of Diveristy and Inclusion is Segregation.

Ask them why they want to bring back Segregation.
  26. I don't want only our country to be a shithole, we want the entire world to be a shithole just like us.
  27. Or what? They'll stop buying sanitation services?


Water and electricity?
  28. Im sure the swedish govt would be upset if the U.S. embassy closed and went home. s/

The trumpleforeskin regime is trying to force his mentally insane garbage on the world.  The world laughs at his foolishness.
  29. ‚ÄúA DEI policy-short for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policy-is an official document outlining an organization‚Äôs commitment to creating a workplace where everyone feels valued, respected, and able to fully participate, regardless of their background or identity‚Äù 

And this is what the American administration is ‚Äúagainst‚Äù?! Welcome to the dark ages guys! I wonder how they handle this in Belgium? ü§î
  30. JD Vance is on the diplomacy trail again.
  31. New address 

US embassy 
Obama Street 
Stockholm
  32. What are they going to do? Airlift everything and pay tariffs instead of sourcing locally?
  33. Now I'm curious if all American embassies are sending such remarkable letters around.
  34. I think it‚Äôs important to understand that they are not talking to us. They are making statements to appease their own administration and it‚Äôs narrative. No reaction will change their course, there is nothing Europeans can do to get any conclusion on these silly verbal aggressions and they will not stop with this nonsense because we show outrage.

Ignore them, don‚Äôt react, obviously never give in and do not give them any media coverage.
  35. Just kindly inform the US embassy that any employees that can‚Äôt respect local laws are welcome to leave the country.
  36. The trump admin continues to embarrass us citizens on a daily basis.
  37. Yeh America has no say outside of the embassy. The lunacy of current american administration
  38. Trump is a lunatic.¬†
  39. Why the hell does our government think they can tell other governments how to do things?
  40. Ugh, the arrogance to think you can demand shit like this of a different country. Never been so embarrassed to be an American as the past 6 months.
  41. This is America‚Äôs true face. Just a bully.
  42. You know, nobody likes foreigners coming to their country and immediately forcing their own world view on their host country.
  43. US goverment tried to pull this shit with Finnish university, they demanded the university stops using certain words in its releases. Words/ expressions like "equal society", "climate change", "inclusive society" etc. They have some nerve, unbelievable. Like how foreign goverment thinks it has any right to censor the use of language in universities of other countries'.
  44. I‚Äôm an American‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ 

SERIOUSLY?!?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME WITH THIS BULLSHIT?!?!
  45. I believe these ‚Äòdemands‚Äô all around Europe coming from American embassies and whatnot are coming directly from Russia and are designed to troll us.

Just ignore. Never feed the troll.
  46. do I think the DEI programs AS THEY WERE IN AMERICA were good? no hell no. do I think eu countries should do as much with this stuff just to butthurt magatards? fuck yeah bring it on I want the hillarity to continue
  47. US  businesses and embassies must swear obedience to uphold the host country's equality, diversify and inclusion. It is not up to Trump how a country runs its own politics
  48. The land of the free telling other nations how they should behave within their borders üôÑ
  49. I hope they rename all of their sewer plans ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù or something like that. But on the other hand, those work and perform a critical public function.

Maybe they will rename their dumpsters.
  50. Trump likes to think he can control the world.  We need to keep showing his fanatics that he's wrong.
  51. Is their government run by 5 year olds? Why do they even care? Half their population probably thinks Sweden is in sub-Saharan Africa anyways.
  52. Sweden should rename the street outside the US embassy E. Jean Carroll Street. Although Fuckwit Avenue also has a classy ring to it.
  53. The us embassy can go f**k itself
  54. This isn't really funny, though it is easy to ridicule. In fact, it's infuriating. They are demanding that we accept their levels of stupidity and the wonderful American way of doing things. 

I wonder how they'd react if our embassies in the US started sending out letters demanding that they meet our DEI standards.

Tell them to fuck off or go home.
  55. The reply should read:

‚ÄùDear US Embassy,
We do not recognize your request. Are we to understand that you no longer require services from the City of Stockholm?‚Äù
  56. How long until our  (EU) patience ends and tell them to go fuck themselves?

They demand, they insult us behind our back in group chats, in front of us in Munich, funding the far-right parties all over, threatening Denmark and selling of Ukraine.

I'm starting to feel a *real* hatred for that dumpster  fire
  57. Stockholm should rename the street the embassy is on to something funny
  58. I used to follow the U.S. embassy on facebook, but ever since Trump inaugurated, they've been posting complete bullshit and people are flaming them in the comments.
  59. lolwat
  60. The Gulf of Mexico Avenue
  61. I'm English, but I hope that I speak for Sweden when I say "Eat my whole ass, America."
  62. Sweden it‚Äôs your city and country, do whatever the hell you want. Don‚Äôt listen to us Americans. Please.
  63. Im so embarrassed to be American
  64. Jesus Christ. The US administration is full of the biggest dipshits ever known to this earth.
  65. If the American embassies cannot comply with Swedish law, Then the employees have to go back to the US.

I can't see why, for example, the Swedish electricity company, heating supplier, etc. should change their way Just because the US leadership and a third of their population have lost their minds  ,
  66. They are an embassy and should behave like one. I bet they've never even googled 'diplomacy' 

It would be against Swedish law to accommodate the US embassy's demands.
  67. US embassy in Oslo tried to send this shit to their power and heating company. Would be fun if they cancel.
  68. The irony of the USA trying to hold Stockholm hostage to demands and wanting them to love the USA despite that abuse is not lost on me.
  69. I find it quite annoying just how much the EU is sleepwalking in all of this. The big announcement of 850 Billion in defence spending which is basically the 5% defence spending Trump has asked for. And if if we don't spend it on our own industries - then it becomes a tribute to the USA.

And so, what is Europe doing: Investing in existing industries? No. We are buying more F35's. Even Denmark is.

I hate to say it but if this was an "awakening" we barely opened one eye to go back to sleep ... if you look at it factually Trump is walking all over us. Even on duties - now we are going to buy more US Gas. Fine. I guess we need it. But that's exactly what Trump wants. Meanwhile all help to transition our economies have been drastically reduced... 

The only ones that woke up are the Canadians (and to an extend) Australians who at least voted in Labour governments. Canadians are actively boycotting US products... and us?

We were loud and angry for about 2-3 weeks... now... not much.
  70. Whata fascist piece of menure elon trump is
  71. Cocaine
  72. Sounds like a terrorist group
  73. Interesting what they will do if for example companies providing water and electricity in Stockholm will refuse to sign that type of contract.
  74. Astounding levels of stupidity...
  75. Hillbilly control freaks
  76. America trying to bully the world into not hiring and gay or black people is peak American. I‚Äôve heard stories from WW2 where local towns people in UK pubs would beat the shit out of white Americans soldiers after they demanded black soldiers were kicked out and not allowed to be served. Just a general bunch of c-nts that don‚Äôt deserve the amount of wealth they have. The sooner Europe, Aus, Canada, and Asia team up to trade and ignore the Americans the better.
  77. üñïAmerica, shit hole country!
  78. Maybe US can just fuck off back to Gilead, nobody cares
  79. So the american people voting for ‚ÄûPump & Dump‚Äú are dictating now in Sweden and the rest of Europe that, for example, women voting rights should be reduced.

Interesting developments.
  80. Respectfully, get fucked. Thank you.
  81. 'OK, we won't include everyone. Nazi yanks, fuck off'
  82. Stockholm and any US embassy hosting city should rename the street where the embassy is located to a famous personality considered as DEI for maga people. I mean they renamed the golf of Mexico without having the authority to do so, why not doing the street when we do have the authority to do so. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
  83. They are becoming the joke of the world at this rate
  84. Time üëè to üëè go üëè home üëè to üëè America!
  85. Yeah, that's not going to fly in Sweden. Go to r/Sverige and see what people are saying.
  86. Ya dec√≠a yo que escuchaba como risas..Claro,son las risas de los suecos que oigo desde Espa√±a.
  87. 21st-century imperialism.  No wind-driven sailing ships, no pointy hats or knee-high socks worn with boots that have buckles, no natives wearing loin cloths, just one country using its embassy in another country a couple thousand miles away to tell the host country how to act and what to think.
  88. What the fuck do they think they're doing?
  89. This almost sounds like Malicious compliance from the embassy. It‚Äôs a good way to make Trump sound even stupider
  90. The US has lost any credibility due to Trump's fanaticism.
  91. At this point, why doesn't Europe and UK just expel US Amabassadors? They're not gonna stop trying to shoehorn their way into our business and politics.
  92. Fascism is now a US export.
  93. lol whatevs.

Sweden should place tariffs on assholes from other places.
  94. Hey Europe, if the US goes bust, any chance us Blue states could get some sort of trans-Atlantic federation going with you guys? No pressure, I‚Äòm sure even us Blue states look like nutjobs at this point.¬†
  95. Stockholm's Department of Building: "Fuck off" but in Swedish
  96. Would be nice if Stockholm tells them to shove it. How is it this administration dictates to other countries what they can and can't do??? What a load of BS
  97. kick em out of the country?
  98. Us embassy has shit to tell them. Fuck the US and fuck Isra√´l
  99. They can fuck right off.

Kind regards, a swede
  100. They're making demands of foreign cities now? The audacity.
  101. This is becoming cringe. The entire planet is laughing at you America. 

Do they realise  this isn‚Äôt Hollywood and they haven‚Äôt actually won a war since 1949, and I mean victory not some painted bullshit sign on an aircraft carrier.
  102. In response, they should send him a can of Surstr√∂mming
  103. Who the fuck they think they are?!

They're there at the PERMISSION of Sweden (A permission that can be revoked at any time and the embassy and it's staff expelled and the US can't do shit about it.) And now they want to boss around the world more than they ever did?

I hope Sweden tells them to eat a bag of shit!
  104. Stockholm: "k bye".
  105. As a US citizen I think the only proper reply by the city of Stockholm should be.

Fuck off!
  106. How do you say "Go fuck yourself" in Swedish?
  107. I‚Äôd change the name of the street of the USA embassy to ‚ÄúTrans Rights Boulevard‚Äù, that should put dem yankees in their place.
  108. Dear US Embassy, fuck off.
  109. Every time I think Trump and his goons are done with their idiocy....
  110. Get the fuck out of my country with your fascist deathcult.
  111. Brave move to publicity threaten the people whom you depend upon to collect your trash.
  112. The proclamations of the mad king have unexpected side effects.
  113. Kick. Them. Out.

Isolate them.
  114. Just turn their water off and put a "Swede's Only" port-o-let on the curb.
  115. I miss when politics was boring.
  116. Well I can't get the site to translate on mobile but I just wanted to say to any Swedes in the comments that the Swedish translation for "Log In" being "Logga In" is adorable.
  117. If I was the said office I'd say: "russian warship! go fuck yourself!"
  118. oh god.  it's endless with trump.  he trolled americans for eight years.  first as president and then as an exile.  and now that he's back, and americans who hate his guts essentially are used to his bs....he is trying to troll europe to get a rise out of them.

what an awful person.  it sounds trite, but really....just an awful person. as are the americans who voted for this mess.  awful.
  119. This is just pathetic...
  120. US should just stfu
  121. > DN has previously reported that the US has demanded the same thing from Swedish companies that supply goods and services. The embassy responded in an email to DN that "US missions are reviewing contracts and grants to ensure that they comply with the White House's latest executive order."

Starve.  Them.  Out.
  122. The correct course of action here is to evict the embassy.
  123. How did Americans become such a joke in just a couple months time lol
  124. America is demanding people the world over to just lie down and accept the fascism they are desperately trying to export.
  125. I just can't comprehend the levels of fuckin arrogance
  126. It's almost like they want to be trolled. The city officials should DEI even harder.
  127. I, for one, am fed up with these foreign nationals coming to Europe trying to impose their so-called culture.
  128. If you don‚Äôt like how I do things in my house, you know where the door is.
  129. Just expel the embassy personnel
  130. Hey Sweden...kick them out!
  131. From all of us to all of you, get fucked.
  132. So, just asking out of curiosity, would it be illegal for a group of people to fill up super soakers with surstr√∂mmingspad and saturate the entire area around the US embassy with the liquid?
  133. The US embassy is the biggest eyesore in Stockholm. Every other embassy in √ñstermalm is a beautiful 19th century villa. Meanwhile, the US embassy is [a brutalist steel and concrete rectangle surrounded by a chain link fence, security cameras and armed guards](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/USAs_ambassad_i_Stockholm%2C_2010.JPG).  
A bit paranoid, are we?
  134. Thats insane.. absolutely insane. Wtf are the USA doing?!
  135. The clash between American stupidity and Swedish bureaucracy is going to be an epic thing to behold.
  136. God, American exceptionalism really knows no bounds.
  137. Equality? I thought it was equity the US was against.
  138. I feel sorry for the embassy employees who are simply there for the job and now have to deal with this utter nonsense.
  139. This is exactly how it looks when a fascist government starts dividing the world into "friends" and "enemies." The next stage involves articulating the misdeeds and crimes of those countries, followed by the organization of "friend" nations into a peacekeeping force, bent on protecting the world.
  140. Stupidity has no borders
  141. Can‚Äôt make this shit up
  142. I remember when the Taliban embassy in New York made the very same demands of the US
  143. How do you say in Swedish "go fuck yourselves"?

  2. The arrogance of America knows no bounds.

  4. I can‚Äôt help but feel this is the first salvo in these MAGA idiots‚Äô plan. They‚Äôre dumb, but I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre so stupid that this is simply limited to demanding other nations abandon diversity. 

I really don‚Äôt think they should be underestimated.
  5. The Stockholm City Council has rejected the US embassy's demands that it roll back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at the behest of the Trump administration.

In his inauguration speech, US President Donald Trump vowed to end what he sweepingly but vaguely called efforts to ‚Äúsocially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life‚Äù. 

This has translated into attempts to eliminate programmes in the United States that seek to encourage diversity and equality in education, the work force and beyond.  

In an email to the city's planning office dated April 29, the US embassy asked that Stockholm officials sign a document promising that contractors would not operate any programmes promoting DEI that would violate current US law.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so bizarre,‚Äù Jan Valeskog, Stockholm‚Äôs vice-mayor for city planning, told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Tuesday. 

The city council said Friday that it would not comply with the embassy's demands or offer an official response.

‚ÄúWe were really surprised, of course,‚Äù Valeskog told The Associated Press.

‚ÄúWe will not sign this document at all, of course not.‚Äù

Valeskog said that while the city wants to maintain a good relationship with the US embassy, it will follow Swedish law and current city policies even if they include DEI practices.

Countries and cities across Europe have received similar demands from US embassies ‚Äì including France, Belgium and the city of Barcelona ‚Äì all of which have lashed out at the attempt to expand anti-diversity policies to the continent.

Trump administration asks French companies to comply with DEI ban

Questionnaire sent to French firms

The US embassy in Paris sent letters in March to several French companies warning against pursuing diversity programmes.

The letters, sent to firms currently doing or looking to do business with the United States, included a questionnaire asking them to certify that they "do not practice programmes to promote diversity, equity and inclusion".

The questionnaire added that such programmes "infringe on applicable federal anti-discrimination laws" in the United States, where Trump signed an order banning federal DEI programmes the day he returned to office.

"We would be grateful if you could complete and sign the document in English within five days and return it to us by email," the letter read. 

"If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal services," it added.

The letter told companies that Trump's January 20 executive order rescinding DEI programmes "also applies to all contractors and suppliers of the US government, regardless of nationality or country of operations".

France lacks US-style DEI policies 

France hit back through its ministry of foreign trade.

"US interference in French companies' inclusion policies is unacceptable, just like its unjustified tariff threats," the ministry said.

"France and Europe will defend their companies, their consumers, but also their values."

France does not have US-style affirmative action policies, and French law bans treating individuals differently based on origin, ethnic group or religion. Even conducting polls asking about ethnicity or religion is illegal. 

However, many large companies have sought to diversify their recruitment pools. A 2023 study found that close to 97 percent of French CEOs were White. 

France does require companies with more than 1,000 employees to try to promote gender equality, with benchmarks such as having at least 30 percent of executives be women.

Economy Minister Eric Lombard's office said the letter "reflects the values of the new US government" ‚Äì but not French values.

"They are not ours," it said. "The minister will remind his US counterparts of that."

  6. Here is the question: Can the US decide what a city of another country should do with diversity?
  7. Technically he's free to do whatever he wants in his country. But what gives him the right to try to change foreign politics?
  8. I say, extra pride festivals in European cities, with special parades around US embassies and consulates!
  9. They've tried this shit here as well (Norway) with the companies that have contracts with the US embassy. They pretty much just laugh it off
  10. Oh look; Trump and his lackeys thinking they control the whole world and that they can dictate policy for other countries again...
  11. ‚ÄúTrump vowed to end what he sweepingly but vaguely called efforts to ‚Äòsocially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life‚Äô‚Äù

This might be the dumbest quote I‚Äôve ever heard in my life. Race and gender are already socially integrated into society you fucking dolt. They form the basis of fucking almost everything.

Only privileged people (like white wealthy men like Trump) are capable of dismissing race as ‚Äúengineered‚Äù since they‚Äôve never needed to suffer with anything related to it. For them, race is just an abstract concept talked about on the news, in school or in social media.

But the most ironic thing is, these people DO suffer from gender norms. A lot (although nowhere near as much as women or trans people), but on the flip side they‚Äôre immensely privileged as a gender in societal hierarchy, and to maintain that requires denying the hierarchy even exists. Men can be depressed and sad and have issues with conforming to completely artificial and harmful masculine traits and expectations society puts on them and still be like ‚Äògender isn‚Äôt real!‚Äô Well yes, if you deny that the main thing causing you harm doesn‚Äôt even exist as a concept, then don‚Äôt expect that pain to go away anytime soon.
  12. "You have to abandon DEI projects" "aw, come on, Norwegians are people too, you know?"
  13. They‚Ä¶. they are aware these are sovereign states‚Ä¶. right‚Ä¶?
  14. I hope the USA tries this nonsense with a German city, too. It would be soooooo funny to see the Trump administration be confronted with a long legal letter, quoting various paragraphs from the "Grundgesetz f√ºr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland" and the "Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz".  
  
We have the best words in Germany, so long. You wouldn't believe how long our words are, Donnie.
  15. The cities should each request the us embassy to commit to DEI. Otherwise, they would no longer be allowed to do business in the city.
  16. God they're insufferably boring. What next? Are they gonna get offended by M&Ms and Skittles being different colours?
  17. I hope the city of Stockholm only send black  trans garbage collectors to the embassy going forward.
  18. The next city to get a demand should just reply:\
"Lol, No."
  19. I think the maga kids listened too much to putin and thought Europe actually was a vassal state.
  20. How about they back the fuck off.
  21. Finnish universities stopped US projects rather than giving up their principles.
  22. US asked France to stop treating black people so well during WW1 cus they might  ask for more civil rights when they returned home after the war, not much has changed
  23. I don‚Äôt think Europe ever had American-style DEI programs. The US went overnboard with this stuff around the time of COVID.¬†
  24. The US thinks that any developed country outside the US is just like the US‚Ä¶
  25. No one should appease, obey, or cater to Trump and his idiotic ideas. Demand your government officials to say NO to Trump. The world must refuse him.
  26. America once again forcing it's regressive views on the rest of the world. The same thing it accuses china and the middle east of
  27. it's like he hears me every time i think "i could not possibly get more embarrassed to be an american". ffs
  28. Love it. America is an absolute shithole of a place.
  29. So fucking embarrassing for this backsliding asshole of a country.
  30. France also refuses this request!
  31. Why the hell do people even need to listen to what that vile Donald Trump and his satanic minions have to say? 
Stockholm and any other nations do not need to adhere to that lard of evil. That man isnt god. He is but a mortal lifeform whose ego is as fragile as a parasitic mosquito.
  32. I want a pony
  33. Put tariffs on US hate
  34. It‚Äôs so sad that society is still trying to force everyone into one tiny box completely ignoring that we are supposed to be unique and diverse.
  35. Evil people gonna evil 

I‚Äôm talking about the US
  36. The thing is that though words like "equality" and "diversity" feature constantly in the language of swedish organisations in both public and private sectors, there are generally not formal requirements to have a certain % of this or that. The rules are soft and practiced fairly arbitrarily.

So even though they are omniprescent, there's little to attack here. Sweden isn't like the UK or Norway, where there are quotas and bonus points for women or minorities.
  37. Nobody from the current White House administration would be welcome in my home. Thank fuck I don‚Äôt work with them, because that would mean having to listen to them. I guess there really is a price for power and influence.¬†

Most of the people in this administration talk and act like Matilda‚Äôs parents- Trashy, ignorant, arrogant, and rude. I genuinely feel sorry for their partners and families for having to deal with them. That‚Äôs why so many people left Elon Musk.¬†
  38. I hope everyone tells project2025 and their puppet trump to piss off. Signed, not enough US citizens.
  39. Wish swedish companies learn from this.
They pandered already.
  40. Sorry guys, we let apathy win and now morons are running the show‚Ä¶
  41. So much for 'America First'
  42. The audacity lol.
  43. It's time we accept it as normality
  44. Thank you.  Keep it up.
  45. I didn't expect anything else. üòÇ
  46. Bravo ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ
  47. what a sad time, refusing does nothing to you
  48. Sweden is a notorious bigot.  This is hilariously ironic.
  49. Sweden is one to talk ü§£
  50. USA. Now a collection of nutters proselytizing   their latest brand of scientology on the street corners
  51. Fuck the US
  52. Lucky for you all, living in Europe- us Americans are stuck with this asshole‚Ä¶ will sending over an apology help at all??
  53. The amusing part is that a good chunk of "wokeism" comes directly from America too.
  54. I like to see people sending a middle finger to nazis.
  55. Unity is a strength.
  56. I don‚Äôt like the word Woke, but i do hate most politically correct things. But with that said, fuck America and for them to trying to push whatever we are doing over here. You do you and we do we! 

Fuck off
  57. Thing is the U.S has been making a case in favor of progressiveness and diversity for decades now. Through gradual changes in their policies and in the type of messages they spread worldwide through Hollywood and other U.S media. The western world has then gradually followed suit. 

Undoing this cannot be achieved by shoving a ‚Äúokay, now stop‚Äù message down other countries throats. And yet that‚Äôs how Trump does everything, by force. 

International resistance to conservative ideals will continue to grow with him in charge and I‚Äôm all for it.
  58. The prejudice and hate sickens me as well as the arrogance and gall. Not to mention Why would you cite our laws like treat have any influence in another country üòÇüòÇüòÇ
  59. Diversity helps foster understanding, which is great for curbing hate. Of course the current US administration don't benefit from doing this. Hate makes it easier for extreme political parties to get elected.
  60. Good.

Cities aren‚Äôt just infrastructure - they‚Äôre made of stories, tensions, and contrasts.

Stockholm refusing the request makes sense if you care about the future, not just control.

Diversity isn‚Äôt decoration. It‚Äôs how a place stays alive.

You can‚Äôt build trust or resilience by erasing people.

You don‚Äôt get new ideas from everyone thinking the same way.
  61. Sweden was one of the least diverse countries in the EU.

Since they opened their doors to mass immigration their society has rapidly deteriorated where as the rest of Scandinavia hasn‚Äôt fully followed their example.¬†

There is a clear straight line between immigration policies in Scandinavia - the more open their immigration policy the more the government has lost public trust.¬†

Homogenous populations is cited as one of the reasons Scandinavia is so prosperous.¬†

Sweden is a case study in what goes wrong when you move away from that.
  62. The nutters should not interfere in internal affairs
  63. They should just say, sure whatever you say. Good luck to the Americans proving that they‚Äôre not doing ‚Ä¶ what exactly?
  64. Hey everyone please only send the Wokest DEI'est contractors  to work on US embassies around the world ... These assholes need to stop.
  65. They sent it to Stockholm city's planning office. The stupid ass ambassador needs this office for building permit. Without them they can't do nothing.¬†
  66. We can manufacture our own diapers can you?
  67. r/BrandNewSentence
  68. "no lol" only response that's needed really
  69. They really do think that the world revolves around them
  70. Sweden loves gay peopleüá∏üá™ü§§
  71. go sweden !
  72. I‚Äôm no fan of DEI-policies but this is completely the right thing to do. The US has no say in the local policies of European cities and municipalities and the fact that they (Trump) think they do is beyond dumb.
  73. It has a name, it's called Stockholm syndrome.
  74. They always saw us as their little subservient. They gave protection... We obayed.¬†
  75. Lmao they're such edgelords 

I am calling upon the total might of the God blessed American government to compel you now to end diversity. All diversity must end.
  76. I try to stay informed as to what this crazy administration is doing, but this is news to me. Can you imagine receiving a letter like that?  I like the French response and hope that everyone responds the same way. This is absolutely insane and extremely embarrassing!
  77. üí™
  78. America can go fuck themselves üñï
  79. D E I is racist in its definition, so he's right. However asking another country to do this is a bit of a stretch.
  80. Diversity is the spice of life. Europe needs all the spice it can get!
  83. how is a request to return from diversity hiring (discriminatory) to merit based hiring (non discriminatory) bizarre?
  84. It's not bizarre at all under the guise of all of these "once beautiful" cities being oppressed by the horrible, woke DEI people. It's first step to set up making the world great again.  :(
  85. If you know anything about Swedes... you would assume this would not fly in a million years... or... until they elect some fascist
  86. This reminds me when usa got nations to ban Cannabis and other drugs.
  87. The USA is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome
  88. Let the states enjoy their iron curtain and just avoid their products and other garbage, brought to you by the 3rd choice host of the apprentice...
  89. Why do they (The US) care?

They tell they don't want to be involved in European matters, which I understand. But then why these absurd demands?


You do your thing and we do ours, right?¬†

The US is a shithole compared to Sweden. Infant death rate 4x that of Sweden... well pretty much by every metric it's closer to 3rd world countries than Sweden.

IDK what to think about this absurd world.
  93. The irony that Stockholm would refuse to make this irrational connection with the US on this matter while they the US tries to hold the world economically hostage.

  1. Following the revelation that Viktor Orb√°n is supporting a far-right nationalist candidate in the Romanian presidential election, P√©ter Magyar, leader of the Tisza Party, announced that he would walk all the way to Oradea (Nagyv√°rad) in a week and a half.  
The slogan: *One million steps for peace and national unity*.

The goal is to heal the wounds caused by Orb√°n's politics of hatred and to bridge the divides.  
Anyone is welcome to join the march.

They set off today, with a huge crowd waiting for Magyar in Budapest.  
Photo: 24
  2. Peter the Hungarian
  3. 30 km a day for 10 days is no joke.
  4. Meanwhile Orban walks 3 steps from one Rolls Royce to another with an uncomfortably heavy suitcase, in the name of European division.
  5. Support from Serbia üá∑üá∏üá≠üá∫
  6. Meanwhile the goverment preparing to enforce Russian style foreign agent law‚Ä¶ fuck Orban!
  7. Thank you P√©ter for giving a cause for a positive news about Hungary in this sub.

√Årad a Tisza!
  8. Good luck from Romania!¬†
  9. The hungarian Kilicdaroglu

He did the same as member of opposition in turkiye against erdogan and his party
  10. I wish you good luck from Romania, I hope that we get the right leaders for our countries‚Ä¶ times are getting corny day by day‚Ä¶
  11. Magyar P√©terüá≠üá∫üí™üåä
  12. I'm so scared orban will make some excuse last minute and send him to jail or something...
  13. √Årad a TISZA!
  14. I‚Äôm in the picture :D
  15. I can't wrap my head around how the whole world turned into fucking Turkey, like all countries are now going through what we've went through in the past 2 decades.
  16. For our freedom and yours üá∑üá¥üá≠üá∫
  17. Support from Germany!
  18. I'm waiting for Orban to fall from power so we can once more say "Polak Wƒôgier dwa bratanki" without having to make any disclaimers
  19. Despite this, after today's news we are cooked.
  20. Fucking come on, Hungary!

üáÆüá™üá™üá∫üá≠üá∫
  21. I took part in it for a bit ‚ò∫Ô∏è


Change is happening in Hungary. I was Orb√°n supporter in the past. More and more people are waking up.
  22. Magyar started off as an ambitious member of the Fidesz inner circle who turned against them. Then little by little he grew his party with quality people, reacted the numerous attacks against his party and family in a gentlemanly manner that completely disappeared from the battlefield that is the current degenerate Hungarian politics.

His Tisza party seems to be the rational, considered, pro-EU voice that stands against the regime of Orb√°n. Currently Tisza is leading the polls with considerable margin.
  23. I wonder how long before he either gets imprisoned or falls out of a window. Hungary is not a democracy any more.
  24. And I will walk 500 miles
  25. Support from Romania üá∑üá¥
  26. That‚Äôs one way to run for office ‚Äî or should I say, walk for it
  27. That is something I would go for!
Unite and believe in peaceful decision-making! There is so much we need to work on to create peace
  28. Impressive
  29. ok, but how is someone called magyar not already the president of hungary? its literally in the name
  30. Thank You
  31. Following the example of students from Serbia, who walk between cities to join local protests on a weekly basis, they ran an ultramarathon to Brussels ‚Äî 1,400 km.

And if you asked yourself why - Google it
  32. Man, I hope Hungary will get rid of Orban this time
  33. 300 km? That's a marathon with a political agenda!
  34. Exactly like Forest Gump
  35. Dont fuck it up again, Hungary.
  36. Students of Serbia did this first
  37. 200 more miles and 500 more and he would have been the man who walked a 1,000 miles to fall down at my door....

Da-da da da (Da-da da da)
  38. Better walk orban and his goon down the green mile
  39. This is a nice initiation. Go for it!
  40. Saw it from the serbian students ;)
  41. isnt orban a dictator?
  42. He just read The Long Walk and this is his excuse
  43. check 2018 armenian velvet revolution lol
  44. But I would walk 500 Miles and I would walk 500 more
  45. Forrest Gump?
  46. Just doesn't sound as good as 500 miles
  47. Lads and ladies, sorry to ruin this for you but, and you probably noticed, the weather fucking sucks over here, it's rain all day every day, don't get sick just for publicity.

Better to stay healthy and work on getting rid of Orban, that's the first real step to peace and unity.
  48. He is just copying Serbian students.
  49.  Do not rely solely on this one major protest. Let it continue naturally, but don't stop there. Engage with people, smile, and truly listen. Let your politics be rooted in the people's needs. Always stand by democracy. Be present ‚Äî in the streets, the squares, and the markets.

If you‚Äôre counting only on this protest to bring votes without doing real groundwork, you risk losing another election ‚Äî and Hungary may drift further into autocracy.

You might ask, ‚ÄúHow do I know this?‚Äù Just trust that it‚Äôs true.

Note: Support a popular and trusted candidate.

Extra: Many rural voters might not even know what you've been doing. Make sure they do. Visit them. Listen. If they feel heard, they will support you. Don‚Äôt lecture them on how democracy should work ‚Äî they don‚Äôt need that.
  50. Western lead coup when?
  51. Why is this a big deal? I‚Äôve never understood people doing pointless tasks like this. I especially don‚Äôt understand the admiration.
  52. Arre Rahul Gandhi, aap yahan?
  53. He doesn't stand any chance at all. That's the reality here.


My source is I've lived in Hungary for years.
  54. These are just stupid people. Hungary is actually doing phenomenally under Orban and it's much better than any opposition.  
Whoever is marching doesn't know what he is doing ... I tell as someone who had similar case in his country 15 years ago.... and now we regret choosing the opposition.....
  56. The Hungarian opposition leader, Magyar P√©ter, opposes arming Ukraine and supports "pragmatic" relations with Russia, including Russian involvement in Hungary's energy system. Why should we be celebrating him for being only less worse than Orb√°n? Same old Hungary, same old problems.
  57. He's advocating for the unification of Hungary and with parts of another EU member, just because he opposes Orban does not make him right

Also Orban has been vocal about how Transylvania is ethnically and culturally Hungarian, even defying the Romanian government, so I think they would agree on this topic...
  58. He's walking to Romania in a region that Hungary is still claiming, in the name of Hungarian national unity, and you guys are cheering...

Would you cheer the same way if a Russian was walking from Moscow to Kiev in the name of Russian national unity?

  2. I find the care of the local farmers very touching. Thanks for this picture!
  3. For anyone interested: it is a war cementary. There was a huge battle between Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies in the area around 1915 and Austrian ministry of war took care of the fallen, no matter from which army. There are approximately 400 war cementaries in the region of West Galicia.

  5. Why is the cemetery in the middle of a field? Was there a village or settlement there in the past?
  6. I didn't expect to see Gd√≥w on Reddit, ever. 

I spent countless childhood summers and winters there, at my grandmother's old wooden house, by the river Raba. Climbing trees, skipping stones, fishing, tobogganing, sleeping on hay in the barn. I'll never forget the taste of water from the local well and the taste of freshly baked bread made in the neighborhood. Great memories. A blissful, picture perfect childhood if there ever was one.

  14. Beautiful contrast between the yellow fields and that small green cemetery. Something peaceful yet haunting about it sitting there alone, surrounded by farmland. History preserved in such a simple way.
  15. One of great grand uncles was killed near Arras in France.  Back then they tended to bury fallen soldiers close to where they fell and he was one of 196 buried at the Sunken Road cemetery at Fampoux.

  1. The Danish women had spent 1,5 months in New Zealand when they went to Hawaii. They had met German girl on their travels and wanted to do some volunteer work she told them about. When the officer heard, they were questioned, searched and imprisoned without being able to contact their family. They were imprisoned for 3 days, before they got a plane back to New Zealand.

They didn‚Äôt know they couldn‚Äôt volunteer. The Danish foreign ministry has since updated the travel guidelines to the US‚Ä¶
  2. It just makes no sense to me.. during my holidays I have seen people with visa issues (in Romania and Germany) and the attitude in both countries was quite simple: you are not granted entry. You can contact you embassy, you can contact your family.. you can stay in the aeroport until you get your next flight back home.. you can ask for accommodation until then. Stuff like that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è No arrest. No handcuffs. No humiliation. Wtf. Worst case scenarios might be: you get aggressive and it makes sense to ask for security or something in your papers is "shady" and you are asked to wait until they do some background checks with the authorities. That's all. Wtf..
  3. Meanwhile US media:

"Europe has turned it backs on USA causing tourism drop".

You can filter using different parameters. I live here and don't feel safe traveling, I can't imagine trying to visit from another country.
  6. But they'll tell you UK doesn't have freedom or something
  7. as much as it annoys me to say this as a US citizen, it's not a safe place to visit right now.
  8. Yes we get it. US does not want contact with outside world.
  9. There it is. The exact reason to avoid the US as a tourist. The Trump administration already has no problems deporting U.S. citizens without due process. So foreign tourists would have been the next group on their list.
  10. I don't travel to places that are openly hostile or dangerous.  North Korea is an example.  

Stop traveling to the USA.  The USA has made their position very clear about "forgeiners", if you are going on holiday go someplace you can relax and enjoy yourself.
  11. USA is a 3rd world country with no friends or allies apart from Russia.

I would be utterly embarrassed if I was American.

Land of the free and brave? No land of the corrupt and brainwashed.
  12. Don't go to the US.
They don't want you there. They don't want your money. And if they can f#ck you over, they will.

Proceed with caution and at your own peril.
  13. USA: largest asylum for the mentally challenged or insane.
  14. Don't go to the US.

What part of that didn't they understand?
  15. Fuck America üá∫üá∏ and their cult leader üñïüèª
  16. I‚Äôm going to the US in a few weeks to attend a 3 day conference. Got hotel and everything booked and in my esta application, will carry physical copies of my hotel reservation, conference ticket and all that to prove my reason for visit. When asked why I‚Äôm entering US the business or pleasure question. Will I be fine when I say business? Then I assume they will ask what kind of business and I say attending a business conference and then any follow up question about what conference and where. Super nervous about this and kinda don‚Äôt want to go there this year but my work is kinda requiring it. 

Appreciate any help or advice!
  17. Feels more and more like the U.S. just wants to become isolationist. If people from other countries don‚Äôt want to go there and other countries want to stop doing business with them, then they have a lot less pressure to conform to societal norms. This is a first step in implementing radical changes to local policy because everyone else has already cast them aside as a lost cause. Look at North Korea, Myanmar, Egypt, Russia, they all have done similar things. Made their countries less hospitable or trade friendly and then tightened the chains on their population.
  18. From "the land of the free" to "the land to flee!"
  19. Are these the girls that were strip searched within a split second of being detained? Officers seemed awfully quick to pull the trigger on that one, although I guess that's to be expected from American police.
  20. When you travel never ever ever say you‚Äôre going to work or volunteer without a visa. You‚Äôre there a visitor! This could‚Äôve happened before trump too, it‚Äôs just enforcement has gone back in time
  21. Set aside the total unreasonable behavior of CBP or whoever put the ladies behind bars: you must have been sleeping under a rock for years if you don't know that the word 'work' doesn't exist for you once you left the plane

You get your visa waiver and will be on vacation and you know EXACTLY the day you will leave the country
  22. Wile Hawaii is a blue state it gave us Tulsi Gabbord
  23. America is becoming everything they tried to convince us China was.
  24. It‚Äôd be on thing if they were simply refused entry and plopped on the next flight home. No prob. 

Its the arrest and detain for weeks thing that‚Äôs utter bullshit.
  25. To be fair even before the orange man it was automatic entry rejection if you were to volunteer on a tourist visa/ESTA.

Denmark (And Schengen) has the same rules by the way, you would absolutely get denied entry over here for the same thing.
  26. At least they are out of there now. But it seems lots of people still haven't realized that the US is not safe for *anyone* to visit.
  27. Honest question, were they not allowed to arrange a flight out sooner? Just book the first flight out and pay the extra cost, either by themselves or using their parents credit card?

They admitted to their visa mistake, but are protesting the 3 days detention. Which I understand. Although when I was younger I would probably have done it just for the experience and a story to tell the grand kids later.
  28. Am I missing something? Of all the shit happening right now in the US, this seems quite legit. Wrong or no visa. What would you expect?
  29. I can't help but notice that most cases of¬†tourists imprisoned over some minor visa issue in the US have been (presumably attractive) young women. Somehow I don't think that's a coincidence.
  30. Just young people saying stupid things. What were they supposed to do, when they admitted they were coming for work? Even voluntary. 

That is a big trigger word for immigration staff. You want to travel worry free? Stick to the EU but also don't mention work if you are not a citizen from a EU country.
  31. > They were looking forward to visiting family and after a meeting with a German girl in New Zealand, they had planned to do some volunteer work on an organic farm.

SELF INFLICTED. Arrived on tourist visa with the intention of working, the fact they don't get paid for it is irrelevant. What the fuck did they think would happen? In most countries in the world, including the EU and the UK, you will be deported for turning up on a tourist visa with the intention of working.
  32. You've never *been* allowed to lie on your visa form before though. This isn't new.
  33. That's why the German Federal Foreign Office adjusted their travel recommendations regarding the US a few months ago.
  34. I paid an extra $200 Canadian to avoid a layover in the states and instead layover in Mexico on my way to Central America. Well worth it, I think
  35. 5 years ago my colleague (british) went to the u to visit our parent company. Joked in the airport "that if he likes it here he will stay for the rest of his life" - got refused to enter and several years of ban to enter the US.¬†
Those guys at the border take everything very seriously.
  36. The U.S. is a dream vacation destination right now?
  37. Fascist USA.
  38. Though currently a while off I can‚Äôt imagine right now how the World Cup/Olympics are going to play out.
  39. Boycott the U. S. A.
  40. Hm, a german article claims [they're from Rostock, Germany](https://www.ostsee-zeitung.de/lokales/rostock/rostockerinnen-landen-in-trumps-abschiebeknast-in-den-usa-haben-uns-so-machtlos-gefuehlt-IZTSKHTUI5DY7D7JVRYTZP64AE.html), I'm pretty sure it's the exact same story though entirely different names
  41. I don‚Äôt know why people keep telling the truth to the border officials. 

I‚Äôve done wwoof in Denmark and you best believe I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm staying with friends‚Äù ‚Äúhow long are you staying?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, but i know I only have 90 days in the Schengen zone, so no more than that‚Äù

Although that probably wouldn‚Äôt work in America right now. Fucking brutal. My boyfriend (a German) and I cancelled our trip to America because of all of this shit. I am an American, but I can‚Äôt imagine anyone thinking they‚Äôre an exception to the cruelty.
  42. Translation:

The dream trip was in full swing.

After a month and a half in New Zealand, two young Danes, Frida and Uma, recently turned their compass towards the United States.

Next stop: Hawaii.

Uma and Frida otherwise felt well prepared, but the great backpacking adventure into the world ended abruptly: With both girls in handcuffs, hours and days filled with uncertainty, deprivation of liberty, and an experience that today stands as a poignant reminder that there is not much room for the slightest blunder among American immigration authorities.

For three days, Uma and Frida had a good view of tall palm trees bathed in sunshine through a window.

But the half-head-wide window to the picturesque beaches of the Aloha Island was located in a massive gray brick building better known as the Honolulu Federal Detention Center - more or less the equivalent of a prison where the US government detains criminals, illegal immigrants and others whom the US authorities will not approve for entry into the United States.

Uma and Frida had a feeling that they had their papers in order when they stood in line at passport control at the airport after arriving in Honolulu.

Several months earlier, they had completed and received approval for what for many Danes is entry to the United States, a so-called ESTA, a kind of pre-approval.

They were looking forward to visiting family and after meeting a German girl in New Zealand, they had made plans to do some volunteer work on an organic farm. The contact with the farm had been made through the organization WWOOF - World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farm.

    As soon as I mention volunteer work, the officer tells me: You can just stop talking.
    Uma

Therefore, they had in no way imagined the course of events that followed after they stood at the passport control counter on the morning of April 23.

- As soon as I mention volunteer work, the officer tells me: You can just stop talking, and then at about the same time we are taken up to a waiting room where there are a lot of other people waiting, Uma tells DR's foreign affairs podcast Stars and Stripes.

The two girls spent the next several hours in the small waiting room, where visits to the bathroom were accompanied by an officer who locked them in and followed them back in. No one was ready to answer what had happened and what was going to happen before the girls were called in for an interview, where they were asked in detail about their plans for volunteer work.

"It's only then that we realize we've made a mistake that will cost us entry into the United States," says Uma. By that time, the girls had been waiting for five hours, and a recurring theme was that they were not given any information about what had happened.

Then came a discouraging message: Their intention to volunteer was not related to their so-called ESTA. That would require a work visa, which they did not have. Therefore, they had to leave the United States. And the girls' action in good faith would have even greater and more violent consequences.

- We never in our wildest imagination thought we would end up in that situation, says Uma.

According to the girls, no one from the WWOOF organization informed them that the volunteer work required a visa, and they had not found information about it anywhere else.

Changed travel instructions

According to the girls, they did not find information about volunteer work and special visas on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' website either.

This week, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs changed its travel guidance to specifically state that you cannot enter on ESTA "if the purpose is education, work, or if you are going to run a business. This also applies to volunteer work."

Previously, it stated more generally that you could be denied entry or deported if you have ‚Äústated a false purpose for your trip, have previously stayed in the United States for too long, or if you have previously been convicted in the United States.‚Äù

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed DR that the changes are being made because "based on a number of citizen inquiries, we have seen a need to highlight and elaborate on parts of the travel guidance, including matters regarding entry and stay."

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms that the two young Danes have been denied entry to the United States and that the ministry has provided consular assistance in the matter.
Handcuffed and taken away

For Uma and Frida, there was no other option but to do as they were told by the American officers at the airport. Even though they offered to drop all plans, the intention to work on the farm was enough to trigger the ban on entry into the United States.

But it was only here that the agony began in earnest.

The next flight back to New Zealand didn't depart until three days later - and the waiting time had to be spent in detention, without personal belongings and zero access to the internet and the outside world.

After about eight hours of waiting, countless questions, fingerprinting, mouth swabbing, photographing, and body searches, the girls were handcuffed and led through the airport to a police van with bars on the windows, which drove them to their temporary residence, the federal detention center in Honolulu.

- When I saw Uma in handcuffs, I broke down, because seeing your travel companion and best friend in handcuffs is something I never thought I would see, says Frida.

When meeting with the detention center, the same procedure is followed as at the airport and in addition, the girls have so-called mugshots taken.

- One of the officers joked that I could use it for my Instagram, Uma remembers.
Cell 105

In the detention center, they are given underwear, socks, a t-shirt, a set of green clothes and plastic shoes.

- It was like watching a prison in American movies and TV series. We were met by 25 women who we didn't know were real criminals. That's when we found out, both girls say, and continue describing:

- It was a huge gray room on two floors with cells all around with numbers on them and then a metal table in the middle. We were given a cell with a metal bunk bed, where there was a closet and a toilet, but there was a window in the door so you could always see in there, even when you had to go to the toilet. And a tiny little window inside the cell - cell number 105.

The hours and days in the American detention center near the airport are slipping by for the two girls. The time is spent writing in a diary. Frida is doing puzzles. All the while without information about what will happen to them.
During the three days the girls were in custody, they wrote a diary. (¬© (c) private photo)

"We met a Belgian woman in there. She was the one who told us everything about how the prison worked and the rules in there," says Uma.

- She had started writing a book on paper in there about how corrupt she thinks the prison system is. We both write diaries from home, so it was normal for us to get a lot of thoughts down on paper, says Frida.

After three days with the Belgian woman and the other women in the detention center, the girls have a meeting with an American immigration lawyer, and for the first time they feel like they are actually getting some information about what is happening.

- We suddenly felt on equal footing with someone. They were there to help us, and they could give us a lot of information about what had happened legally, and that our parents had booked a hotel in New Zealand the next day, so suddenly there was a certainty that we knew what to do. We had had no contact with our parents, so it was absolutely crazy, they say.
Many arrests in Hawaii

Also earlier this year, there have been stories of other European citizens who have been denied entry to the country due to what is considered in the United States to be incorrect or suspicious entry grounds.

    I believe the arrest and detention of Uma and her friend was likely the result of the Trump administration granting arrest quotas to every Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in the U.S.
    Esther Sungeun Yoo, manager

Still, a refugee and immigration lawyer from the University of Hawaii believes that this is unusually harsh treatment of the two women.

- I believe that the arrest and detention of Uma and Frida was likely the result of the Trump administration giving arrest quotas to every Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in the United States, writes Esther Sungeun Yoo to DR.

She is the head of a legal service that has assisted the two young Danes and says that immigration lawyers in Honolulu have seen higher levels of arrests and detentions of travelers at the airport since the arrest quotas were introduced.

- Some of the people we are now seeing arrested are not like those we saw before.

On the first day of his inauguration, on January 20, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that, among other things, orders maximum scrutiny and security checks of foreigners attempting to enter the United States.

  43. Is it only because of Trump or has it always been like this?
  44. If they had been US missionaries in another country, allow he'll would break loose but because it's not religious volunteerism...
  45. Avoid the US, visit Canada instead, or literally any other country that isn't governed by a dictator.
  46. In 2010, I did the same thing these girls tried to do and had no problems, thank god. I did volunteer work in various national parks in the South West.

The organization I went with stated that a tourist visa was enough for 6 weeks of volunteer work. Almost all volunteers (most of us were from Europe and South Korea) came with a normal tourist visa.
 I was asked the purpose of my visit at the border and told the truth without thinking twice as I was under the impression that I had the right visa. Luckily, I was let through without any problems. Maybe I was just lucky, or the rules weren't enforced as strictly back then? 
What a nightmare for these girls...
  47. When the Republicans are in control, everyone in the USA is a criminal to the state, even their voters.
  48. They're Danish. I'm surprised they weren't kept as hostages until Denmark signed over Greenland ffs.

Don't go to America, not even after Trump is gone. Fuck those morons.
  49. Just don't go to US.
  50. I hate the Trump administration as much as anyone, but hope I can add some context to this that most people aren't getting.

You can't enter the US, EU, or many other countries for volunteer work under a tourist visa/ passport. I watch one of those airport border guard shows (This particular one follows customs officers in Spain and Australia) and one of the common themes is people attempting to enter the country for volunteer work. They're always sent back if they are trying to enter on a travel visa (or visa-free passport). So it comes as no surprise these girls met the same fate.

As to why there were sent to a prison: it's because they literally aren't allowed to enter the US and their flight back to New Zealand wasn't departing for 3 days. They're not going to let them live in the international airport terminal for 3 days, and they can't put them into a hotel because again, they're not allowed to enter the US. I agree it seems excessive, but unfortunately it's just shit luck they didn't have a flight back sooner. What's not clear is why they didn't just put them on the first flight back to an EU country...but maybe the girls insisted on New Zealand? The article doesn't state.

But in summary, I don't think this has anything to do with the Trump administration. This would have most likely played out the same way if they tried entering any other day this century.
  51. People should study before visiting any country to never say work, perform, volunteer anything, not tattooing, not playing music, just a tourist 

Just say "I'm a tourist"

"how will you afford your stay here "  " My family will send me money from overseas they are funding my vacation to tour the USA"
  52. Stay out of visiting the USA unless absolutely necessary now.  It‚Äôs too dangerous.  You could be jailed and sent to Guantanamo or el Salvador.
  53. Reason #1276526 to not set foot in the US again.
  54. You'd have to be crazy to visit the US while ol' Poopy Magoo and his rejects are running things. The inmates are running the asylum here, even in Hawaii. Don't come here until he's gone. It won't be worth the hassle. 

And we don't deserve your tourist dollars right now. We are a global embarrassment and I feel the need to constantly apologize for it. This is not who we are.
  55. US is doing this deliberately to scaremonger. Stay TF away from it. 
We're in the UK and just had a wonderful week in Denmark. Spend your cash in other places instead.
  56. Just stop going to the U.S., ffs‚Ä¶
  57. The ironic part is that 50% of US farm workers are illegal immigrants. Many of them are even children. But they all get to both stay and work in the US because "Americans need food"..
  58. Working illegally in Denmark can get you jailed and deported very quickly.
  59. Not knowing the rules is not an excuse

Volunteering is working which one is not allowed to do on an ESTA
  60. People need to stop traveling to the states.  At least until Trump is out of office.
  61. Never go on holiday to third world dictatorships
  62. Still baffles me that people in this day and age would travel to the us out of their own free will lol
  63. Never in my life will I step foot in that shithole country.
  64. Did they not hear about the USA?  Did nobody warn them?
  65. Gee whiz, I wonder if stories like this have anything to do with the fact that tourism in the US from europeans is cratering?
  66. Seem like the WWOOF organization did a huge blunder, but wow treating these people like criminals and sending them to what is essentially a prison is fucked up.
  67. I wonder what Tramp would say if they treated American tourists like that?
  68. Okay, folks.  If you're a foreigner going to another country, maybe look up the rules beforehand if you want to volunteer.  But again, thank you for volunteering.  But just know the rules.
  69. Stop visiting the US!!! It is under an authoritarian regime. Read the news please!
  70. Too bad they didn't follow the news. Europeans - including us Danes - are absolutely not welcome in that wierd, freak country. However, the government should have officially warned about travels there. We don't want our citizens abused by these twisted people.
  71. Each day US looks more and more like third world country.
  72. At this point I wonder, why anyone still wants to visit the USA.
It's a third world country in the coat of a first world country, it's judicial system is a tremendous joke, it's government is a circus, leaded by the worst president in US history (twice).
Why would anyone visit this country?
  73. Hope the USA does alright without all its tourism in a year or two. Assuming we aren‚Äôt all at war by then.
  74. While I in no way support the treatment they were given, or the increasingly hostile immigration policies of the US, the mistake they made has similar consquences in many other countries. Work, even if it's unpaid volunteer work, may still be considered work by the authorities, and accepting compensation in the form of free lodging and food on a tourist visa may be seen as a form of tax evasion. [Here](https://www.nrk.no/innlandet/xl/juliana-mattson-fra-usa-skulle-laere-okologisk-jordbruk-i-noreg-_-ti-dagar-seinare-vart-ho-utvist-1.17002276)'s a Norwegian story about a US tourist who was misled by the same organization, and had to face the same consequences (but possibly slightly more humane conditions).
  75. As a Canadian who father has worked for 20 plus years in the US on a work visa with his company, who retired during the first Trump term. Yeah, be very careful what you say or have right now if you are traveling to the US. In his own words, It's going to get much worse.
  76. Hmm, I feel so protected by this kind of action. /s
  77. The most stupid Nation does heavy nazi stuff and people still think its a good idea to visit?
  78. This really isn't newsworthy. The ESTA- application process asks (or states) about intention to work, including volunteer work. 

However dumb the CBP system is, they were just as dumb to essentially break the rules of the visa.
  79. This is why I don‚Äôt dream of vacationing in the us anymore. It‚Äôs scary over there
  80. Seriously, fuck the US. I'll never go and I'll discourage anyone I hear wants to go.
  81. No offense but we kind of told you not to go to America and it‚Äôs not simply for boycott üòÇ 

Remember this Canadian actress who travelled and got detained for 12 days to an ICE center in Texas? Lol she‚Äôs an actress and she was flying to some other big city but they arrested her, detained her and then sent her to Texas! She was this close to end up in Salvador. 

I‚Äôm not risking my life
  82. And Rubio tries to school us germans about independent branches of democracy...because an constituional institution to protect the constitution has declared the afd as a threat of constitution with a 1000page report written over the course of years and not legal binding yet because a court has to approve it first...


The last time someone could end up in a prison camp and disappear in our country just for not having correct papers or being of a specific ethnological background was more then 80years ago. Back then nobody was considering the system democratic but as with trumps politics... I must be too dumb to understand this 7D multidimensional chess¬†


Edit....yes there was also DDR which is more 40y ago ...dispite the name it was more a suppressive system like sowjet Russia. In any case none of them are free or democracys. And not a good reference to be compared to
  83. At this point I don't understand why anyone is traveling to the US.¬† It is not safe, just avoid it.
  84. What people outside the US need to remember is they are incentivised to put you in prison because of a foreign profit prison system and detainment/detention system. Anywhere else in the world they're disincentivised to imprison you, but not in the US. That's why it has the worlds largest prison population.
  85. Sorry.  We're trying to get rid of these nuts in the current administration but it will take a while.  Please enjoy the rest of the world until we are able.
  86. I'd like to think this story is hard to believe. It isn't.
  87. So the article about the Canadian woman went into the profitability of these prisoners.  
And that‚Äôs really all it is.  
If people find a way to make money, they‚Äôre gonna keep doing it, consequences be damned. And the only real way to stop it is government regulations.  
But what if you pay off the government too?  
Then the only way to stop it is outside pressure on the government.  
But most of the pressure has been about ‚Äúsolving‚Äù the issue of ‚Äúimmigration‚Äù (non Americans).  
The US has devolved into a late stage capitalism racket. If you can make a buck, make it, fuck the long term consequences, they don‚Äôt matter.  
Hell if it gets bad enough but they‚Äôve made enough money they can just fuck off to the EU, live on their yachts and leave their ‚Äòshithole country‚Äô behind.
  88. Because the USA are a fourth world country where idiots vote to lose freedom, where the country is run with only money as a cornerstone ,while wealth disparity is on the level of Zimbabwe or Namibia.
  89. This is why Europeans should not travel to US for now.
  90. Well, Europe warned them not to come here to this shithole country
  91. In which planet were these women living before? Were they not reading what happens to foreigners visiting the US in the past 5 months?
  92. Well they had the wrong Visa. In most of the articles where tourists are detained it‚Äôs just the tourists fault. When I travel I usually inform myself thoroughly so that stuff like this doesn‚Äôt happen.¬†
  93. Donnie gave them arrest quotas, they are looking for ANY excuse.
  94. üñïAmerica
  95. Hostile country. I don't get why anyone would go there voluntarily.
  96. it's no wonder why tourism to the U.S. is down.  Any non-U.S. citizen would be crazy to come here for any reason.
  97. Why go to the US? Don't buy their products, don't travel there, don't sell to them. Just stop!
  98. Between ice and customs, I think the us is going to experience a lot less tourism. Fafo.
  99. You can't enter the US under a tourist visa and work (or volunteer.)  This isn't new under Trump, but because Trump is a nutcase wannabe dictator that does everything in a ridiculous, over the top manner, it's in the news more.  You'd think this would raise awareness among those that enter the US that working in any way when not authorized is not acceptable, nor tolerated in any way.  Yet it keeps happening.
  100. What is it going to be like when people try to enter in 2026 for the world cup?  Are we going to be flooded with more stories like this?
  101. land of freedom
  102. Stop going to the new nazi coutry ! Simple! Is shite!
  103. This same shit is normal from people coming to Europe from poorer countries. Now the difference is thst this is happening to rich white Europeans going to the US. But the essence is the same.
  104. So they talked about breaking the law in front of an officer and then they were detained (IMPRISONED LOL) for 3 days until they could be sent home?

Jesus christ the propaganda sensationalism goes crazy

=== POST #41 ===
**Title:** in 6th European Political Community Summit, After President Macron placed his hand firmly on President Erdogan's hand, Erdogan did not let go of Macron's finger. And this interesting moment occurred.
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 19110
**Comments (200):**
  1. Exactly what my senile grandpa used to do
  2. Erdogan: Drugs or old age?
  3. Was trying to make him fart
  4. Maybe he had micro stroke at this moment
  5. They are merely exchanging long protein strings. If you can think of a simpler way, I'd like to hear it.
  6. Macron was lucky he wasn't wearing a ring. Or else Gollum might have gnawed the finger off.
  7. Look at his eyes


Another problematic world leader with dementia. Is resignation realistic or will some shadow council take over?
  8. All of these people are so weird. Like, why does everything have to be a power play of sorts? Sheez.
  9. Is this some weird power play or is he having dementia?
  10. The new Ariana and Cynthia.
  11. He was just holding space for him. Awww.
  12. I wonder what that was all about> Very interesting!
  13. early signs of dementia! thank god for once, lets hope it gets fast- normally would never wish something like this but he is evil beyond words
  14. Erdogan was a snapping turtle in his past life
  15. Okay grandpa let's get you to bed
  16. "Can you pull this finger for a moment?"
  17. This is such a pathetic ‚Äúpower play‚Äù by these weak ass old men. Trump has taken the same tactic with Macron in the past (not releasing after a hand shake). It absolutely screams weakness, and a deep desperation to appear strong. 
It‚Äôs honestly laughable. 
Some other commenters have mentioned it may be a sign of dementia, to which I don‚Äôt disagree.
  18. Could europe please stop playing so friendly with dictators?
  19. Did Erdogan experience a glitch in the matrix? That was a little odd.
  20. Honestly, there aren't many things I hate more than the relation we have with Turkey. Turkey should be a cultural and economical powerhouse fully integrated into Europe. Fuck, such a shame.
  21. Lol seems like Erdogan may not have liked Macron trying the whole placing your hand on the other persons hand move
  22. "Pull my finger"

-Children Of Men-
  23. "I have pulled your finger, little Frenchman. Now fart."

"I don't think that's..."

"I didn't ask you what you throught, I pulled your finger. Stop procrastinating and fart!"

"I..." \*toots shyly" 

"Good enough, little Frenchman, good enough."
  24. Howard Stark once said: *‚ÄúShake it don't pull it.‚Äù*¬†
  25. "Hey.... pull my finger"
  26. Recently this senile old man, Macron so dearly shakes hands with, prisoned his main competitor and his whole executive team on bogus charges, jailed hundreds of university students protesting it, and dozens of journalists who reported it. There are documented reports of sexual abuse and torture under custody. He denied lawyers being present in trials, ignored the constitution and basic human rights of the protestors. Protesters denied food, water and toilets for days. Some needed to relieve themselves and sat on it for hours. 

Fraternite, egalite, liberte my ass.
  27. I don't know how leaders can be so chummy with him while he throws his political opponents in prison
  28. Seems Erdogan was in a mood  to hold some pee pee.ü§îü§îü§î
  29. Senile. He is decomposing.
  30. Old people are weird¬†
  31. de-men-tia !
  32. Lol what kinda fetish is this?
  33. Obviously just a speculation, but this kind of grasping typically underlies some forms of cognitive impairments like dementia and frontal lobe damage.

I don't think it's a power move, it's too silly to be that.
  34. I'm seeing a senile old man lose it for a second.
Hope still exists for the future, just not for him and his attitude and actions for the past decade.
  35. Was it not just the time needed for the interpreter to tell them what the hell each other had just said?
  36. All fucking dictators (and wannabe dictators) are so weird!
  37. Disapponted.  Not a single "Smell yer maw" reference.
  38. Erdogan.exe ist not responding. He may respond again if you wait.
  39. It‚Äôs Erdo‚Äôs mental and moral decline‚Ä¶
  40. So macron said ‚Äúpull my finger‚Äù and erdogan fell for it.
  41. "Pull my finger."
  42. Senile bastard
  43. Did he freeze like McConnell?
  44. Clearly a joke shared at the end of that exchange
  45. Old man does weird things. More at 11
  46. ‚ÄùDon‚Äôt up-hand me, you pussy!‚Äù
  47. There should be an age limit for leaders, like 30-60. After that they should go living on their private islands.
  48. Neurologist here. Search for "grasping reflex"
  49. Can we please get new leaders in the world? How is it, that Turkey, USA and Russia have old unfit clowns as their presidents?? We need younger, more charismatic people in those positions. Like Macron
  50. Why are all these authoritarians soooo fucking weird?
  51. I think Erdogan is super gay. After this comment I do not dare visit Turkey again because I know I will be arrested and sent to jail without trial.
  52. I think he believes if he pulls it hard and strong enough, Rafales will come out of him! 

No harm in trying right?
  53. For those saying about Erdogans's age, there is a simpler explanation: he shifted his attention to what they were saying. 

So the interesting part is what it was said more than the hand.
  54. Pull my finger jokes?
  55. presidente? presidente!?!
cit.
  56. baby brain activate!
  57. He's buffering
  58. It would've been such a power move to fart at that moment.
  59. I think erdogan thought Macron is the kid named finger
  60. He is a brain dead zombie
  61. Did Macron farted? That is the actual question.
  62. Looks like he is having a Moscow Mitch moment.
  63. Dementia hitting hard huh?

Good.
  64. Bro? Now pull my finger!
  65. Jesus thats very weird
  66. Erdogan is looking like "death warmed over."
  67. Funny how the other sub was talking about this being some NLP type shit brainfuckery and asserting dominance and here people just straight up call him senile and has no fucking idea what he‚Äôs doing
  68. They only tolerate Erdogan because Turkey is in nato. He‚Äôs a tinpot dictator like many others
  69. When a handshake turns into an international hostage situation.
  70. This is how turkish grandpas troll you
  71. Palpatine
  72. We wasn‚Äôt letting go till he pulled a fart out of him
  73. Baked
  74. Dude was out of it there for a while.
  75. Sometimes I really feel for macron. He has to go through a lot of shit.
  76. Macron let out a massive fart as Erdoƒüan pulled his finger, everyone laughed hysterically!
  77. If I were Macron, I would have fingered his hand. If Grandpa Erdoƒüan is being senile, might as well make it sexual to piss him off.
  78. He looks so happy, doing something so childish. If this was my president, I'd be worried.
  79. Macron said ‚Äòpull my finger‚Äô but the fart got stuck in the chamber. üí®
  80. Or could be Erdogan is secretly gay?
  81. We got european Biden before GTA VI
  82. Will Macron accept another challenger in the exquisite art of hand tug of war?
  83. Why is it always Macron going viral over weird handshakes ü§£
  84. What a creep
  86. what they are saying, what is the context, and seems macron had a second hand available... Awesome story...
Btw turkey will very hardly ever be a member of the eu.
  87. I'd have tipped his chair over.
  88. Now kiss
  89. It must be so exhausting being the adult in the room
  90. Another one that's starting to go...
  91. Macron: pull my finger Erdogan.
  92. They are holding space
  93. What's next? peeing on other politicians to gain dominance?
  94. u/SaveVideo
  95. Stroke patient lol
  96. Low key best buddy type shi
  97. An ominous sign
  98. At least he didn‚Äôt try to smell it üòÇ
  99. How about an age restriction to being fucking head of state?
  100. Now suck it
  101. LoL !
  102. Looks like he had a Mitch McConnel moment.
  103. What is it with all these old senile wannabe-dictators all staring into the void and being unable to behave like normal humans?
  104. Slap.
  105. Giving Cynthia and Ariana
  106. All politics is a dick measuring contest. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to get away with that hand gesture power move on me!‚Äù
  107. Lol his face looks like he is enjoying it ü§´ Or maybe he is mad because Macron is with...
  108. Macron just asked Erdogan to pull his finger but the fart was a lot longer than expected
  109. Looks like Macron is telling something (a joke?), so Erdogan is listening. He acknowledges the joke towards the end.
  110. I don't know why people find this to be weird. In Croatia where I'm from (and probably Balkans as a whole, including Turkey) this is a fairly common gesture old people perform when they want to continue to speak to you after greetings, and demand your attention.
  111. As an American I can confirm this is a politician that has mentally expired due to age, we have several of them that we choose from to replace the prior mentally incompetent Presidents with, it‚Äôs not going well so I assume Mitch McConnell must be our next president.
  112. He 100% saw Macrons future with that look in his eyes...
  113. Erdogan was holding space for Macron
  114. Manchild trying to dominate.
  115. Silent. But deadly
  116. It's not strange because Erdogan doesn't know English so he's waiting for someone to translate for him. He probably wanted to say something so he stopped him from walking away. He wanted to hold he hand but he held his finger. Old people do that sometimes. If they haven't finished talking and you're very active, they'll grab your hand, arm, finger, sleeve or shoulder. Young people are ashamed to catch just to stop someone
  117. ‚ÄúNow pull my finger‚Äù
  118. Kinda looks like Erdogan doesn‚Äôt have a clue what is going on‚Ä¶¬†
  119. Pull my finger!
  120. Power play
  121. Culture, he's not being aggressive with it. I  see this with old men and women in my home country. People are just not uncomfortable with physical contact the way people are now.
  122. Lol this guy doesn't even know where he's at by the looks of him. 

 Old people with dementia symptoms all have the same stare.
  123. They are like kids in a kindergarten
  124. And I thought my awkward moments were bad lol
  125. Top Secret Political Community fact:





This is part of the foreplay before the political gangbang later tonight.
  126. Buffering...
  127. Kind of a Turkish ‚Äúpull my finger‚Äù joke.
  128. Erdogan was holding onto Macron's baguettes.
  129. It's funny to watch macron squirm, as a French guy he's usually pretty comfortable and doesn't have boundaries.
  130. Pull my finger. That fart must‚Äôve been a doozy.
  131. they are waiting for translators to finish translating
  132. macaron did hold his hand from above, as that is the gesto of superiority, maybe the Turk wanted to hold him tight for reciprocity.
  133. he was trying to jerk him off
  134. He is old af, no intentions behind it. It's funny though, anyway, 23 years under his rule, even if we fail at elections mf doesn't have much time left.
  135. He forgot how to let go, you see in his eyes he checked out for a moment. World is run by old men who can‚Äôt let go, just terrible
  136. Look as if he had a 'Biden' moment!
  137. Senile old fuck
  138. how come this world is now reduced to tiptoeing around some very powerful senile gramps?
  139. None of these people should be holding office anywhere. They belong to nursing home. Macron is still ok, but Trump and Erdo were bad enough when they had it together, now they are both struggling to stay awake and remember what‚Äôs going on, it‚Äôs just getting embarrassing.

I mean, at which stage people will learn that you have to let go of power? You don‚Äôt live forever, no one does. 

I am Turkish, enough is enough man.
  140. At last the secret Freemasons handshake is revealed!!!!
  141. I think Erdogan was sandwiching Macron's hand at first while clapping so Macron clapped on his hand too
  142. Ariana Grande ass moment
  143. This is some Ariana and Cynthia level hand holding.
  144. Maybe he was asking what moisturiser he uses.
  145. G
  146. Little man.
  147. It‚Äôs a him for what happened later in the toilets
  148. He‚Äôs just holding space for him
  149. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  150. Shoulda honked his nose
  151. What happened to serious people just make jokes about life come on.
  152. In fact, Erdogan would not have appreciated the other putting his hand on his after shaking his hand....in France we can't stand Macron and his habit of always groping people....
  153. He is fucking with him, Erdogan is petty dictator who has never been accountable for anything, no fear. Turkiye and France don't really like each other despite being NATO allies they have fought a few proxies wars against each other in recent history.
  154. I think he is just interested in a threesome with Macron and his husband.
  155. You can see Erdogan is shameless and illegitimate from his face

We're expecting Macron, PES and Socialist International to take all actions possible against Trump and Putin's comprador, demagouge Tayyiban regime who's been trying to turn T√ºrkiye into Izrael's personal bodyguard



These election results are despite us trying to protect ballots with our bare hands against suppressive regime of absolute minority, who jailed all of his opponents at the moment. At least 70% of us wants them gone
  156. Interesting that Macron is cool with this slimy dictator
  157. Letting him know his social touching isn‚Äôt going to influence him
  158. I want daddy erdogan to hold my finger like that as well üò≥
  159. Guys... Macron just has soothing hands. You need to try it. It's why when he shook babies and kissed hands his public perception shifted! His hands are so soft all the babies stopped crying! Parents loved this one trick all other politicians hate.
  160. Why does his face look like roblox smile
  161. Fun to see that nearly every high power position in the world is occupied by a geriatric man with the brain function of a house cat on Diazepam. We‚Äôll definitely be alright guysü§ô
  162. Master shifu didn't teach him to wuxi finger hold. He is doing it wrong
  163. Fresh Prince of Andorra
  164. Ah yes, "Pull my finger" diplomacy.

  177. Biden? Joe Biden? Is that you?

  179. Dude pull my finger
  180. Boy y'all are looking too deep for shit that does not exist....

  182. Hot man on man action. 

Macron is the pivot guy for the EU

His wife used to be a man.

  196. Why do we literally have a bunch of senile geriatrics running the planet? Enough already.
  197. Wtf
  198. Apes in suites.¬†
  199. Macron often tries to assert dominance with a very strong handshake. He has done it several times with a lot of head of states. This is very known at top levels. So other head of states do it as well to him. It's only a pissing contest.

**Title:** Romanian president signs law allowing troops to shoot down Russian drones in country‚Äôs airspace
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 19029
**Comments (47):**
  1. I am surprised that it wasn't a norm.

Imagine foreign flying objects over your territory with 50kg of explosive each and you just say "that's OK".
  2. Can‚Äôt blame any country for protecting it‚Äôs airspace against foreign interference and attacks, can we now?
  3. Now waiting for Romania to become the second country in NATO to shoot down a Russian aircraft (drone in this case).
  4. Those far-right nationalists are nationalists until it's Russian invaders who invade, then they're multi-cultural pacifists.
  5. Finally, this has been in the parliament for a while now. The right wingers voted against it, and basically were yapping bullshits.
(Some)People were brainwashed ‚Äúwhat interests could russia have?‚Äù.
Etc‚Ä¶

I find it to be the bare minimum. If someone enters my house, ofc I am gonna act‚Ä¶:))
  6. Now that's a great start on your first day at a new job
  7. Imagine if this becomes like that one law in Chester, England, where it's legal to shoot a Welshman with a bow and arrow after 8pm or something.

20 years from now some Russian tourist will be flying their drone around and BOOM, shot out of the sky by a reservist
  8. Why would they need law for this ? Isn‚Äôt it every countries right to shoot down military aircraft violating it‚Äôs airspace
  9. Its about time, finally.
  10. **Acting President of Romania Ilie Bolojan has signed a law expanding its armed forces‚Äô powers, allowing troops to shoot down unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are unlawfully in the country‚Äôs airspace.**

**Source:**¬†[Digi24](https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/evenimente/ilie-bolojan-a-promulgat-legea-ce-permite-doborarea-dronelor-care-intra-ilegal-in-spatiul-aerian-al-romaniei-3247363), 24-hour Romanian TV news channel, as reported by European Pravda

**Details:**¬†Ilie Bolojan signed the law passed by the Romanian Parliament, which authorises the downing of drones illegally present in Romanian airspace, as well as a law on peaceful conduct of military missions and operations on Romanian territory.

**Background:**

* The law on use of national airspace was initiated after several incidents in which Russian attack drones targeting southern Ukraine‚Äôs Odesa Oblast entered Romanian airspace. The legislation was finally approved by Parliament in February 2025.
* Romania‚Äôs far-right parties challenged the law in the Constitutional Court but lost the case.
* In March, Romania¬†[confirmed](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/03/1/7500829/)¬†another case of a Russian drone crashing on its territory, in the border area near the Ukrainian settlement of Reni.
  11. Finally!!!
  12. About time
  13. AUR challenging something like this in court tells me all I need to know about them.
  14. I love you, Romanians. I'm so happy for you. Living vicariously through you from a nearby country which failed the hurdle you've overcome. 

Stay vigilant and thrive ü´°‚ù§Ô∏è
  15. It's about time.
  16. About bloody time!
  17. Inb4 "Russia outraged that another country dares to defend its territory"
  18. Palputin and Drunkmedev will probably threaten again some nuclear shit. üòÜ
  19. And he had to make a law for this? I mean it wasn't obvious üòÇ. Simion would have welcomed them with fireworks and a banner that said "we love you"
  20. Let's remember that AUR where Simion the candidate who lost is the President voted against this law.
Also POT which is full of liars, thieves and illiterats. And other some major political parties
  21. What's up Romanian nationalists, got some shit to say now?! Big patriots, right?
  22. Yeah!! Multsumesc Romania!!
  23. Hmm. I was pretty sure we all are allowed to shoot down those drones.     

But i guess many europeans let drones fly over the border like its a bird
  24. Were they not shooting them down before?!?!?!
  25. Wonderful! üëè
  26. fuckin finally
  27. It‚Äôs always surprising when youre sure something is a thing and read the headline ‚Äúthing now legal!‚Äù
  28. You would think that it would be the norm
  29. This new president can COOK.
  30. Finally someone acts on this behalf.
  31. Well. That escalated quickly!
  32. Reading the official publication is only the decission to repel the complains from the 43 senators and 52 MPs. Hence making the law propositon legal and able to be voted upon, so its not a presidential signature, its only that the law can go further to the president to be signed or returned for ammendment. Once signed, it will be published in the official monitor of Romania and then can be applied.


TL;DR: the law was not signed, only the complains from senators and MPs were rejected and the new ammendment of the law can proceed.
  33. üòå
  34. Why would this need to be law in the first place?

The military doesn't already have the power to shoot down hostile aircraft illegally entering your airspace?
  35. Just the troops?¬† normal citizens should get $50 bounty if they take one out.
  36. About time üôÑ
  37. This wasn't the case already?
  38. I don't understand why you would need a law for this? Does Romania have something in its constitution that prevents it from establishing sovereignty over its airspace?
  39. Seven days to go
  40. noroc... senatate
  41. This is like an after school special where some puny kid stands up to the bully, makes him bleed, and the rest of the kids zerg that asshole.
  42. If Europe does not mature quickly it will pay the price set by the Trump- USA, Russia and China. These quasi  empires ultimately all hate a free and united Europe where freedom is still real as it threathens their authoritarian regimes.
  43. Hey why don't you have that in other countries neighbouring Russia and Ukraine?
  44. dude's first day in office and he is already being BASED
  45. So very brave of them.
  46. How can they tell where the drones come from?
  47. that's concerning and may have dire consequences for romania

while this is very stereotypical to say and frequently misused by politicians, i do think that this point in time what was decided is extremely important for the future of the whole continent. 

i wish Dan luck that he will use this victory wisely and make sure that the reasons why such high conservative vote was there even to begin with will be able to be resolved.

  75. Well done Romania!
  76. This is history guys! We made history today. We must protect Nicu»ôor Dan at all costs! He's not perfect, but he is honest and he won this battle despite all the odds being against him. After such a long time, I finally feel optimistic again. Long live Romania! Long live EU!
  77. I‚Äôm so happy Romania can tell the far right to eat a dick. ¬†
  78. Phew...
  79. Thank you Romanians for staying with EU
  80. For context, this is the first time in 35 years after communism, that we voted FOR a president, and NOT against the opponent.

We call it in Romania "voting for the lesser evil".

This time, not. ND was a top world Olympic in Mathematics in his teenage time, and an activist. He also has not become rich while in politics.
  81. Hmm, at the moment russia has only won in Slovakia, Hungary, and the USA. Moldova and Romania defended democracy. Encouraging. We continue to follow.
  82. Great job Romania!
  83. First time I'm so fucking proud of us, hopefully this can be a good example that will send some shockwaves around as well!
  84. Way to go Romania. You fought for this.
  85. Congratulations to our Romanian friends. 

Europe yet has a chance!
  86. I'm really happy about that.
  87. Well fucking done guys!!! We did it!!
  88. Congrats from Poland! Now Our turn üëç
  89. It's not just pro EU vs pro putin
For me the bigger picture is anti corruption and progress vs corruption and anti progress.
  90. Why does he kinda look like Milei tho üòÇ. Nonetheless it's good that he won ! :)
  91. Thank fuck
  92. We were üåüüåüstresedüåüüåü it's you're time now Poland
  93. There is still hope in this world‚Ä¶!
  94. So proud of Romanians! Choose hope and freedom over hate and tyranny! Much love from Finlandüíô
  95. Congrats from Switzerland
  96. congratulations! greetings from Slovakia ‚ù§Ô∏è
  97. This was an upset victory by essentially the strongest pro-EU candidate in the country. And we are in an economic crisis that he needs to help the government fix. We are cooked in 5 years.
  98. Geez, I really hope this wave of far right Trump clones all over the world is ending soon. Glad the Centrist won!
  99. Good üëç
  100. Congratulations!
  101. FINALLY. The bare minimum of information in English.
  102. One more time, it‚Äôs done!
  103. Congratulations to Romania
  104. Tell that man to stay away from any and all windows right frickin now!
  105. Well done
  106. Very glad to hear this
  107. Yeah! Go Romania!!
  108. Another one bites the dust! Wake up America
  109. A huge victory for both Romania and Europe.
  110. Wonderful news.
  111. Well done Romania, and congratulations.
  112. Do we have voter turn outs stats by age, background etc? Those are always interesting.
  113. The man is an actual , for real, genius. 

He could have been a quant and then opened his own  hedge fund ‚Ä¶ and become a billionaire by now. 

But he became a community organizer while raising his kids in a rented apartment with his partner.


People say he‚Äôs not charismatic, he‚Äôs not the political Mesia. Ok ‚Ä¶ so what? If Rusia, LePen, the Real estate Mafia, the Garbage/recycle cartels, the ruling PSD party, the German far right, elon musks army of fans ( who are definitely not bots) , Steve Bannon and the Tate Brothers All Hate You ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre doing something Fantastically Right!
  114. I've lost friends since November last year, but for the past 2 weeks, even close friends denied me, friends with university degrees, small businesses full of European/American services and tools, but dreaming of being like Russia. Telling them they are sweetly seduced by Russia, they said that proof does not exist like Covid19.

Also more Romanian Christians said that Ukrainian Christians deserve to be killed by Russian Christians due Ukraine it's an invented country. All country/states are invented at one point in history, but the agreed form for this is "founded" so their point is likely useless.
  115. There is hope after all for humanity
  116. Good job Romanians. Sadly we've fucked up in Poland.
  117. Bullet dodged, good job Romania!
  118. Is it fully official now?
  119. This is a huge relief after 6 months of anxiety. I enrolled in the campain volunteering team, it was an amazing experience talking with people! 

It was a hard camapaign on social media! I couldnt believe how easy were some people brainwashed by tiktok
  120. No shit
  121. the fact that this victory is celebrated and is not a given makes me disappointed in humanity
  122. What are his positions? Is he liberal by at least Romanian standards or is he merely a typical conservative who supports Europe and Ukraine?
  123. Yay üôå
  124. Yeahhhh!!!!
  125. üò≠üò≠üò≠üíöüíöüíö
  126. Great
  127. Well done Romania! Showing off the world fascist organisation they are not going to spread any further. Next to get rid of Orban, the Slovak dude, Meloni next.
  128. Well done Romania!
  129. Phew!!! üòå
  130. Just like he won the IMO! Congrats!
  131. Russian bullet successfully dodged
  132. Congrats! Rise up, Romania!
  133. god blessüôè
  134. Go Romania! Good choice..
  135. bruh
  136. Congratulations Romania! Hopefully you avoided Hungary/Slovakia situation.

Ban TikTok the sooner the better. Disinformation attacks will not stop. Someone really wants to isolate Ukraine bordering countries with sone useless leaders.
  137. It‚Äôs bittersweet seeing common sense being used in other parts of the world while the people in my country are getting pissed off over seashells.
  138. Hell yeah, Romania. You fought for your democracy and won!
  139. From now on it wont matter what you are, right, left or center. Its only pro eu and anti eu.
  140. We love him! Everything for our new president! ‚ù§Ô∏è
  141. Thank goodness, can you imagine if we had to cancel the result a second, third, or fourth time until we got the only answer we would allow?
  142. Only took like 3 rounds of blatant blocking of democracy to achieve it.
  143. Anyone going to mention the huge French/EU influence on the election and recall the votes or since its coming from the ‚Äúright‚Äù people its okay and we are going to sweep it under the rug?
  144. The Russian democracy, now with the EU outfit included

**Title:** EU outrage grows after Israel fires ‚Äòwarning shots‚Äô at diplomatic delegation
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 18462
**Comments (109):**
  1. 28.8% of Israels trade is with the EU. The EU is Israels single biggest trade partner.

Israel is only the EU's 26th largest partner ‚Äî at 0.8%

Israel needs the EU.

The EU doesn't need Israel.
  3. How is this not a bigger story?
  4. Nothing will happen as long as many European governments continue to behave submissively towards Israel.
  5. Can EU stop this nonsense and tell Israel to fuck off already? I'm tired of this hypocrisy, we condemn Russia but we close our eyes to Israel...
  6. >The group had been visiting a refugee camp in the Palestinian city of Jenin but deviated from an ‚Äúapproved route‚Äù and ‚Äúentered an area where they were not authorized to be,‚Äù Israel‚Äôs foreign ministry said in a¬†[statement on social media](https://x.com/israelmfa/status/1925167721425080617?s=46), after which Israeli troops fired ‚Äúwarning shots‚Äù to scare them away.

Honestly, seems completely in line with IDF procedure. When in doubt about a problem, don't use words to try to disarm the situation. Use bullets.
  7. Thats bold as hell to shoot at diplomatic representatives, I guess they‚Äôre not happy that the EU is considering economic action against Israel over human rights violations.
  8. Ukraine is safer for diplomats then Israel thats crazy
  9. Member when in 2006 the Israelis started an incursion into Lebanon, but turned around when they had to face off against a platoon of French tanks?

I member.
  10. Guys I am not joking: I just checked *every single* news station I cannot find this event ***anywhere*** here in the states. 

Cbs. Abc. Nbc. CNN. Fox news. 

Nobody else in my family heard of it.

The only reason I know this happened as an American is because of this sub. 

*Please* keep sharing news articles as you find them. There's some sort of censorship going on over here. 

Thank you for posting
  11. Absolute fanatics. Imagine what Palestinians have to live through on daily basis...
  12. Cut all trade and close EU airspace to flights going into Isreal
  13. The EU will still do nothing. Israel could "accidentally" kill them all and the spineless EU would still do nothing
  14. They are capable of shoooting random diplomats from several countries in front of cameras but when we mention that the killing of journalists and civilians are targeted ‚Äúantisemitism ü§°‚Äù there is a reason they don‚Äôt let no journalists see the truth (RIP SHIREEN). I can‚Äôt imagine the daily torment of Palestinians under this zionist occupation¬†
  15. So when does our outrage finally turn into sanctions?
  16. "The IDF regrets the inconvenience caused"

From that you would think what happened is that there was a holdup at a checkpoint or minor damage caused to a vehicle, not people getting literally shot at...
  17. Has Israel already called protest over this anti semitic?
  18. Time to grow a pair and deal with this, Europe.
  19. ‚ÄúThe IDF regrets the inconvenience caused,‚Äù the Israel Defense Forces said
  20. The West destroyed what was left of it's credibility for this country.
  21. It‚Äôs pathetic: just slap overwhelming sanctions on Israel like you did on Russia.¬†

As a reminder: the EU said they put sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Ukrainian territory.¬†

Israel did exactly the same thing decades ago in its invasion and annexation of the Golan Heights, and more recently has invaded more of Syria and Lebanon. That‚Äôs even before you get to the mass slaughter and war crimes in Gaza or the Apartheid in the West Bank.¬†

Yet these cowards leading EU countries just say ‚Äúwe‚Äôll issue a stern message and maybe possibly think about cutting trade ties, maybe‚Äù.¬†

They should have put a total trade embargo on Israel years ago. Are they just scared of being labelled as antisemites by the racist pro-Israel far-right?¬†
  22. So how is /r/worldnews gonna blame this on Hamas?
  23. Now for sure EU will take some drastic measures. Like writing a very serious statement saying this was not cool and never talk about it ever again. Hard to expect anything else
  24. And to think of the fact that EU supported them like crazy for 1.5 years.
  25. Guess they're mad about the Eurovision outcome
  26. I gotta say, this conflict has gotten less and less complicated the longer it goes on. Israel was attacked by a horrible terrorist organization so they decided it was high time to genocide an entire fucking country, who happened to be there first.
  27. EU is still scared of properly punishing Israel, mostly cause of WW2, but also because of possible US reprisals...

It really doesn't matter anymore. Israel has gone full on genocide on Palestinians, and Trump is too busy wtih golf to give fuck about Israel. EU should really use this opportunity to fully blockade Israel, and perhaps save a few thousand Palestinians.
  28. My God, I thought they were using "warning shots" figuratively before reading the article
  29. Israel's response to the outrage this violent provocation has caused is probably somehow going to come down to how they're really the victims in all this... again.
  30. Totally normal thing to do for a democratic state with no ambitions to wipe out an entire population and seize their land. But hey, maybe some politicians even here in Germany wake up after ignoring how the IDF killed civilians, children, journalists and NGO workers.
  31. It is sad that you have to be the ones suffering to realize how horrible Israel is
  32. Their moral compass is gone bonkers
  33. Weird how they have the confidence and skill to shoot and miss diplomats but keep on "accidentally" killing reporters and aid workers.

This one will go down as one of the worst acts of cruelty in history. All other fucked up shit e.g. the holocaust either happened in secret or no one had the power to stop it. 

This one will be notorious for being the first time in history when the world watched a genocide in real time didn't do shit about it.
  34. Enough is enough. Time to boycott. Get it done.
  35. The diplomats were hamas /s
  36. ‚ÄúOutrage‚Äù
  37. Should've cut all ties with Israel a long time ago
  38. When is the world going to outright condemn the current conduct of the israeli regime? It's gone on far enough now. War criminals need to answer before a judge.
  39. The EU will surely send another Strongly Worded Letter while a few thousand more Palestinians die..
  40. I think this is good for the delegates from abroad to see what the Israelis do. Bare in mind, this is them behaving themselves in comparison to what they do to Palestinians.
  41. Better threaten them with a slightly stronger slap on the wrist.
  42. Let's see what the EU will do about this... My guess is.. Nothing
  43. Europe effectively created Israel through a UN vote so it's funny to see how that played out.
  44. Well, damn, they fired on a US SHIP in 1967...in international waters. 34 US crew members (one was NSA) basically murdered.
  45. I don't see much difference between the IDF and the Eisatsgruppe anymore. On foreign soil shooting anything that moves to make space for their own people.
  46. If everything is as it seems, then this has to be one of the top unnecessary self-owns in modern politics.
  47. You know, there's disagreement, there's showboating for the media, and there's disrespect. The EU might need to throw its weight around a few times to establish boundaries.

Also, it may hint at what Israel thinks of the OTHER Palestinian power bloc which did negotiate and held back from joining the attack on Israel.
  48. The  UE will surely block all cooperation with the Israel government any moment now, isn't it?
  49.  Why are we still arming Israel, all the governments doing so are complicit in the slaughter of the Palestinians.
  50. But we have no problem with them taking part in Eurovision and obviously manipulating the vote for propaganda purposes, it seems.
  51. If this is how they treat diplomats and journalists from first world countries, imagine how they treat the poor Palestinians. I heard each year they go on raids to Palestinian farms to burn the crops so they can't sell/eat.
  54. Surprised they didn't keep firing till they were all dead then bury them underground along with their vehicle. Its usually what Israel does.
  55. and eu will still not stop licking israels balls.. seriously what can israel do to make them do what they did in an instant for russia
  56. F*ck the Israeli government. Time to rise up, people of Israel.
  57. It is insane how warning shots on EU diplomats make the news here in Europe instantly on all bigger outlets while the same army executes civilians in the WJL on a weekly or daily basis and no one bates an eye - 1000 deaths and close to 9000 injured Palestinians by the facist occupation force (settlers and IDF - both don‚Äòt have any business to be there) in the WB since the 7th October 2023. People here in the EU even ask ‚Äûwhy are Palestinians so mad at Israel‚Äú. The double standards are through the roof.
  58. Treat them like Russia at this point. That‚Äôs the least that needs to be done.
  59. Article 5!
  60. If you want a laugh, go to r/Israel anytime one of these articles is posted there and see how quickly they turn on your country. ‚ÄúGermany never stopped being Nazis‚Äù ‚ÄúFrance being anti-Semitic again‚Äù ‚ÄúSweden is a Muslim state.‚Äù
  61. Screw Naziyahoo's Israel.
  62. When emissaries of the Great Khan were abused, the response was swift, brutal, and caused a change in behavior. Unfortunately, the EU is nothing compared to the Khan of Khans.
  63. They can do whatever they want, Europe has given them that. If they had a spine they would all react.
  64. Not a single mention in Spanish TV yet and I bet my balls it won't be anytime soon.
  65. I'm quite surprised that this thread has not been brigaded to oblivion by the Hasbara bots of reddit.
  66. Cowards, they will do nothing.
  67. Let's invite them to eurovision again!
  68. Why is this being tagged as an opinion article? Is it the writers opinion that they fired shots and not fact? Bullshit from mods.
  69. In any other country they'd come over and tell you "you've gone off the route"

In Israel they open fire

Perfectly normal country with no problems whatsoever
  70. Will any EU country do anything?
  71. Call me when EU finally starts DOING something against Israel and its genocide against Gaza.
  72. Notice how its totally fine to kill palestinians on the daily, but not the diplomats
  73. I remember (not a particular achievement, it was literally just few weeks ago) when even the most milquetoast criticism of Israel on this subreddit was enough to earn screeches of sympathy with terrorists, anti-semitisim, and on and on, not to mention downvoting into oblivion. Now they are shooting at your diplomats, now they have killed (even more) thousands of innocent people, I wonder do any of you feel anything resembling shame?
  74. Test
  75. Arms embargo when?
  76. That‚Äôs why Europe must be an independent force. Israel‚Äôs sugar daddy USA spoiled these kids too much.¬†
  77. I understand keeping VIPs like Diplomats only within authorized areas is necessary. It's not clear if there was communication through a liason in the vehicle but shooting warning shots at diplomats is the worst way to handle such a deviation.
  78. Things in the Levante are getting hot(ter) again.

How long until r/europe reinstates the moratorium?
  79. Classic lol. Send them another $5 billion.
  80. I wonder what happens when they run out of Palestinians.. I mean do you think they will just, yknow, stop or...?
  81. Sanction them then...
  82. We should heavily sanction them until they recognise Palestine. They‚Äôve had their fun, it‚Äôs already been far too much suffering imposed on Palestinians, now they must stop. Really hope we‚Äôre starting to see the tide turning.
  83. Innocent lives in Gaza are in urgent need of food, medical care, and shelter. Every donation, no matter how small, can make a real difference. Please consider supporting through one of these highly trusted charities:

1. UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) ‚Äì Provides emergency aid, healthcare, and shelter.


2. Islamic Relief Worldwide ‚Äì Delivers food, medical supplies, and support for displaced families.


3. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) ‚Äì Offers emergency medical care on the ground.
  84. Enough withe the terrorist state of Israel, immediately embargo of Israel goods products and services and send back all Israeli diplomates in EU back to the terrorist state
  85. Oh no.... Another mistake that some people will be "let go" for

Anyway, here's why you should hate Arabs from this reputable western source with Israeli ties

Nothing will ever change
  86. Cut Israel off from all non-essential trade
  87. Oh noooo... Israel?? Who would have thought??
  88. Wow a country run by terrorists did terrorist things! I'm super surprised, I'm sure there will be consequences /s.
  89. Abandon Israel. Leave them on their own.
  90. üñï
  91. If the UN won't put a peacekeeping force into Gaza and the West Bank, then Europe should step up backed by Australia, Canada, and S Africa.
  92. This is fucking insane.
  93. Am I the only one who looks at Israeli behaviour and sees Nazis? Like, outright, the exact, same, utter thing?
  94. **Israel:** "We don't want you to witness our acts of **genocide**, so go away or we'll shoot you!"
  95. that delegation was hamas /s
  96. Wait.. why? In no political universe was this a smart idea.
  97. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  98. well

well

well
  99. Not that it matters much these days, but were any of the EU countries represented here NATO members?
  100. It's perfectly fine to shoot/bomb/threaten those who are lesser humans and not God's chosen people.

/s
  101. Frankly, Russia is behaving better than Israel, and that tells you something.¬†


As far as I am aware, Russia is not engaged in active Genocide and mass starvation, but I may be mistaken.¬†
  102. Outrage has been growing for 2 years already. I mean so what. It is not like any european nation is suddenly going to grow some balls. Also those articles about netenyahu being ditched by various world leaders are getting very silly honestly.  Bottom line is that if israel nukes gaza and proceeds to use hostage children they are keeping in their death camps for yearly sacrifice to commemorate that glorious day, the best world could do would be articles in news about outrage. Uuuuu or stern letter of warning. In the end you would have one last show with Piers morgan hosting debate between one guy saying it is not okay to nuke defenseless people and some crazy zionist saying but what else would you have us do? And Piers would have a moral quandary about it.
  103. I swear bibi is trying to commit national suicide in Israel. He‚Äôs making any moderates hate them. It‚Äôs beyond stupid.
  104. Antisemitic post. Also, where are your references to October 7th?
  105. They were warning shots.only because they weren't kids
  106. Might have to write a stern letter.
  107. (nothing will happen)
  108. Let me guess

Israel has a right to defend itself?
  109. Im sorry but that wasnt ‚Äúwarning shots‚Äù those were warning shots. The title suggest they weren‚Äôt real warning shots while they absolutely were.

**Title:** Germany bans far-right 'Kingdom of Germany' group
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 17907
**Comments (70):**
  1. German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has banned the far-right group "K√∂nigsreich Deutschland" ("Kingdom of Germany,") a faction within the so-called "Reichsb√ºrger "(Reich Citizens) movement, accusing it of trying to establish a "counter-state" within Germany.

The ban came as police on Tuesday conducted raids on properties of key members of the group in seven German states, making four arrests, including that of the "Kingdom"'s self-declared monarch, Peter Fitzek.

Fitzek is believed by security authorities to have founded the group in 2012.
  2. There has ever been only one king of Germany and that was Rio Reiser.
  3. INB4 Musk calls them a centrist group.
  4. Anyone know why they're going for "Kingdom" over "Empire"? Feels like a downgrade.
  5. Those Reichsb√ºrger are a special kind of narcissists. They not only think the rules don't apply to them, they also make their own rules and believe others have to comply with them. And they get very very angry when people don't obey them. They are so far out there you wouldn't believe it...
  6. "Only the 'Reichsb√ºrger' can save Germany"

\- Musk probably
  7. this was group that plotted a coup in 2022 I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great loss that they are banned.


Edit: I was wrong a different group but very similar
  8. One of the dumbest groups in Germany.
  9. Very nice. Now do AfD.
  10. "Das Alles und noch viel meeeeeeehr,....."
  11. And nothing of value was lost.
  12. Finally. These loons are just Nazis pretending to be Monarchists.¬†
  13. Do the AFD next.
  14. Shouldnt it be Kaiserreich Deutschland? Germany hasnt been a kingdom in ever.
  15. The first half of the article makes it sound like it's some small cosplay political group and Germany is doing something like banning the left handed flat earther society. But thend the second half describes a terrorist organization with concrete plans to stage a coup. Weirdly written article.
  16. Cue the maga cum garglers to denounce this at any moment

Edit: word
  17. Good.
  18. Don't tell me they are trying to bring the Kaiser back?! ü§îü§îü§î
  19. Incoming outrage from Musk soon!
  20. About freaking time. The entire Reichsb√ºrger movement should be banned. They've been given way too much leeway for much too long.
  21. reichsb√ºrger deny the legal right for the federal republic of germany to exist and ignore the existence of the 2+4 contract as a post-war peace treaty (BRD+DDR and the four allied governments france, uk, usa and ussr).
  22. The whole world could learn from this. Far right mentality is a cancer on society. It must not be allowed under any circumstance.
  23. Do these maggots have nothing else in their pathetic empty lives to be proud about aside from some inherent characteristics? I suppose that explains it
  24. Based Germans. If we could do in Italy with groups like Giovent√π Nazionale and Casapund it would be wonderful (basically impossible with the current government, tho...).
  25. Good for them.
  26. Reichb√ºrgerü©∏ü©∏ü©∏ üçîüçîüçîüòãüòãüòã
  27. Fucking finally! European countries should start banning groups like that and also Russian supported organizations, NGO's and all that. Stop the whole idiotic "democratic" approach where you let your enemy who doesn't believe in democracy destroy you from the inside.
  28. AfD next please
  29. Good. Do the AfD next.
  30. Soooooo AfD is next right?
  31. Yesss
  32. Kingdom of Germany? They should have aimed for the Kaiserreich smh. /s
  33. Monarchism erasure smh
  34. Shouldn't it be Kingdom of Germania?
  35. Meanwhile thr AfD is still stomping around
  36. The fall of the Third Reich‚Ä¶.again lol
  37. Wen AFD?
  38. ...and another group for Trump to import with open arms...
  39. based
  40. This is how u protect democracy
  41. I'm sure the group that doesn't recognize the german government will be incredibly upset about the german government banning them.
  42. Hat ja auch lang genug gedauert
  43. Ban AFD
  44. Fuck them, but that logo looks kinda cool.

Edit: I realized it looked better in the small picture, zoomed in not so much.
  45. Not the first banned andnot the last.
  46. [ Removed by Reddit ]
  47. Wish they did that to AFD instead of a completely irrelivant party
  48. I think this Conservatism thing in Germany has been bubbling up for a very long time. What happened in the 1930‚Äôs and 1940‚Äôs happened but it‚Äôs over. As another poster said when you forbid something it just makes some people want it more. Sometimes jailing people makes them martyrs thus adding more publicity and visibility that they might otherwise not receive. Greta Thunberg is a good example of this, she loves being arrested as it keeps the spotlight on her. Her biggest fear is being ignored and forgotten.
  49. I have a theory that these movements were intentionally established among millennials in online communities during the 2000‚Äôs and the 2010‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a global plan to destabilize democracies and install tech monarchies in their place. I started researching this by looking into Curtis Yarvin, Usenet, and Steve Bannon. A lot of people don‚Äôt know this but Steve Bannon worked for Goldman Sachs and he ran a Chinese based Wow (yes, the video game) gold farming operation. There is a an article where he talks about harnessing his troll army - read children he co-opted into working for his political ends. This along with the ‚ÄúNetwork State‚Äù and ‚Äúpro-natalist‚Äù movements are part of the same plan in my opinion.

I would not be surprised to find that a number of these people found the ‚ÄúKingdom of Germany‚Äù through an online video game or something like 4chan. This  has been a slow burn, the people behind MAGA and Trump have been planning to do this for decades and they should be taken seriously. They have all been recruited from the worst of the internets depravity to work for this singular purpose. There is a reason they lack empathy, they were chosen because they don‚Äôt care about the suffering they cause. The trolls are trying to take over.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/18/steve-bannon-learned-harness-troll-army-world-warcraft/489713001/
  50. I can‚Äôt believe that bunch are still at it. ¬†Weren‚Äôt they arrested a few months ago?
  51. And now cue JD Vance giving us the Europe Free Speech Lecture Version 2.0:   
***‚ÄúIn America, we let our extremists cook.‚Äù***
  52. That‚Äôs the way to do it, just ban the inhuman dumb shit!
  53. I didn't think the Germans would have their own equivalent to the sovereign citizen movement.
  54. Lots of new far right groups popping up in Germany. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not problematic.
  55. Another german group gets slandered and called Thoughtcrime?
  56. Good
  57. The amount of commenters here who think they are a (now banned) political party is pretty appalling. Ain‚Äôt no ignorance like wilful ignorance.
  58. God how I love a functional democracy that proactively deals with it's seditious threats.

(Took them long enough tho, wish France, Italy, Greece and Spain start to catch up with these examples before far right groups try to destroy the EU)
  59. Why won't they ban AfD too?
  60. Lets goooo
  61. Good
  62. Germany just banning opposing political parties while building up its military, nothing to see here...
  63. Good. The US needs to learn from this, but I guess we're too busy claiming the entire victory in WWII.
  64. See America? That‚Äôs how you handle fascism.
  65. A Reich if you will.
  66. I wish they'd address the causes of why people are turning to fascism

You stamp them out you just radicalise them further

Maybe address income inequality and billionaire-owned mass media

I guess to address the causes they'd have to take a look in the mirror though, that's not happening
  67. Love how people think banning extremist things will make them go away and not just cause more harm than if we all laughed at them in public.
  68. Banning opposition political parties? Did Germany not do that in the early to mid-1930‚Äôs? Some things never change, just the people doing it.
  69. Are they monarchist?
  70. Now do something about Muslims ransacking inner cities.¬†

=== POST #46 ===
**Title:** Serbia has seen massive protests for 160 days now, yet no tangible results have been achieved. Are protests even effective in causing regime changes?
**Subreddit:** r/europe
**Score:** 17124
**Comments (200):**
  1. Make it effective please or we are fked - a hungarian
  2. 160 days is a long time. However, many big changes needed even more. Stay strong Serbia!
  3. Keeping this many protesters this unhappy for this long is just asking for a revolution.
  4. A counter question. If protests are useless, why are the regimes so frantically trying to prevent them and using gangsters and violence against them instead of just letting them having a go at it?
  5. OP post is misleading. Serbia isnt under protests, its under student blockades. Not violent - but having an effect on the day to day. Example: Students blockaded the regimes TV media which was unable to produce propaganda for days - result was that they accepted the student demand to re-elect members of the media governing body - REM.

Faculties are under blockades as well - effectively putting a stop to the entire college system. Many more institutions are showing disobedience.

Protests are there to just show numbers and keep the energy up.
  6. General strike. The nuclear option.
  7. Those greedy fucks don't want to let go of the bone.
  8. peaceful protests only work when politicians are in charge that actually care about their people.... or they have to care about being reelected i don't think this is the case in serbia rn
  10. I strongly disagree. Serbia is not the same country as it was 6 months ago. The change has already happened, the fact that the president is still the same is kinda beside the point. People got so up in arms and ready to organize and contribute to the fight that at some point there was a shortage of megaphones on the market. Thousands of people got firsthand experience of organizing a local grassroots movement and a protest (and hundreds of thousands got to participate). People are having something to hope for, and some smaller victories are already achieved. Yeah, there is a long road ahead, but I wouldn't believe you if you told me we could come this far in just a couple of months.
  11. No tangible results?

Government fell and the new one looks like it wont make it past June

People have been released from fear, started standing up to corrupt sheriffs and  criminals

160 days of continuous energy, largest gathering in country's history.

Reconciliation with various minorities which are actively particpating and supporting students

President losing a lot of power and status he's had, he cant even go public out of fear of beeing hit by an egg

One big point is that people have lost all respect for Russia and EU, people who used to be EU leaning are no longer and same goes for far right which is mostly criticizing Putin now.

These effects are gonna be much more long lasting and will bring more effect to the country than if the President resigned immediately
  12. Demonstrations and civil disobedience in Iran started in October 1977, the government was toppled in February 1979.

Sometimes these things take a long time and require an escalation in violence before any meaningful change happens. This is doubly true for countries with an existing de facto authoritarian regime in place.
  13. Protests are just one of almost unlimited possible tactics that can be used in nonviolent civil resistance. If you use one tactic, then the regime will need to counter one tactic. If you have millions of people participating in diverse, coordinated tactics aiming to undermine support by converting supporters into dissidents, the regime will need to counter the scale of those activities. It seems pretty logical to me that, if our strength is in numbers, we should be using tactics that leverage that strength through coordinated mass action and by unleashing the sheer intelligence and creativity of the population.

Protests are one of the highest risk tactics to use because they concentrate dissidents in small areas, reveal dissidents publicly, and require incredible stamina and mass outrage to run for long periods of time. It's easy for people to not see change, feel like there is no momentum, and start dropping off from participating. I'm also not convinced that protests really change the minds of supporters of the regime. It's easy for propaganda to undermine protests and cause them to backfire in developing support -- hence they are covered as "riots" or terrorists or just plain lunatics.

Don't just take my word on it. I recommend you read "The Checklist to End Tyranny" by Peter Ackerman, founder of the International Center for Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC) -- a nonprofit awarded the Nobel Peace prize for their scholarship and education around nonviolent civil resistance. This book presents historical, statistical, and practical analysis of civil resistance movements around the world and distills the lessons learned into a series of questions that allow dissidents to evaluate how effective their campaign is likely to be and where they can improve. You can find it freely available from their website here: https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/checklist/
  14. Well, no guarantees, but they can be effective. Ukrainians went to the streets in 2013 and Yanukovich flew his ass to Russia after a few weeks.
  15. Yes they are... Otherwise why would Erdogan and Putin make them illegal or create lots of impediments for such events?!
  16. Filipino dictator Marcos fled after non-violent protests.

Edit: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Revolution
  17. Friendly reminder that EU supports vucic
  18. Many dictatorships lasted decades worth of protests before they fell, so that alone is no reason to give up. However, dictatorships have also been exchanging best (read worst) practices on how to weather popular discontent, and one of the ways they do it is by waiting until people get tired. This is something that protesters always have to keep in mind.

We actually really need the CIA ofold to collapse such regimes illegally clinging to life much faster. Unfortunately, the CIA is an American government institution that's currently under the power of a maniac who doesn't care about democracy, while the EU is too friendly to make such an undertaking. Ultimately, it's not fair that whenever democratization comes closer, such regimes simply weather through protests and/or downright repress all opposition, whereas established democracies sit while internal forces (often using external help) turn people towards autocratic beliefs. We have to be a lot more muscular and vigorous in defending freedoms around the world.
  19. Ask Iron Curtain¬†
  20. That title smells like gaslighting.
  21. As long as people go to work on Monday protesting is largely ineffective.
  22. Like Maidan or like "let's sing against dictator?"
  23. If it was effective, it wouldn't be allowed. 

They allow protests as a guise to make the public feel as if they're showing resistance without actually doing anything tangible.
  24. No. Rioting on the other hand.
  25. Yes. Look at history.
  26. Serbian here. 

1. These protests started with students and as such, students wanted for all protests to stay violence free and without any political parties of the oppositon. We dont want current government and we dont want the opposition since they havent done anything in the same amount of time as government. Because students dont want violence, all protests have been peacefull and with insane honor and dignity of all people involved which our dictator hates, cause he constantly sents provocations to incite violence and paint protestors as some angry mob.


2. EU doesnt want regime change in Serbia. 

The current regime in Serbia gave EU everything they wanted.

 Every year or two the current president (dictator) signs new agreement with so called Kosovo that only hurts Serbia, slowly one by one he signs it. When you sign a deal with someone, if you give something, the other side should also give something in return. Well no. All the deals that our dictator signed was literally just Serbia giving things to Kosovo for no reason at all so they can further opress people in our south province. 

EU also needs lithium to combat China and their car manufacturing and other manufacturing. Germany has bigger lithium reserves, but they know those mines cause MASSIVE damage to ecology, they know german people would not agree, or any other EU country, so Serbia has to do it. That is why EU supports our dictator cause he doesnt care as long as EU helps him stay in power and both EU and dictators regime gets rich. They are literally beating people and threating their children to kill them in order for them to sell lands in Jadar region to Rio Tinto.


3. All media is under control of regime. Every private owned telivision was bought by regime over the years and they are day and night targeting anyone who says even remotely something bad about anyone from regime. Older generations being that they dont even use internet are getting brainwashed for over a decade now with same rethoric. 




4. Final words.


Well there you have it. The reason why protests are slow is because serbian people dont want to get labeled by regime and by EU as some angry mobs that simply want to go into revolution and we no longer want to let paid oppositon take the protests. All the protests are organized  ONLY by students at their democratic hearings at the universities and we the regular people follow and support our smart youth since they are the educated future of our country. They dont want violence and we the people support them. The biggest reason why these protests also are going slow is because EU has done LITERALLY nothing and for long time they tried to hide and ignore them. Serbia is on path to EU and as such, EU has great power that they can use to help people of Serbia. The reason they dont want to is Kosovo and Lithium. Why should they change the current dictatorship when the dictator gives them everything they want as long as they dont against him. In fact it was EU who funded the campaign of the dictator to get him to power in the first place. 



That is the reason why protests are slow. EU basically supporting the dictator and students being smart, honorable and with dignity and not wanting violence between serbian people. But dont worry, we might have chosen longer and harder path, but we will prevail in our struggle for freedom.
  27. Govt knows they can't be that violent with clashing down and are betting it will blow over eventually¬†
  28. Historically? Not really, most of the effect comes from after they stop being peaceful.
  29. It takes a long time, and effort. Governments built around milking their people rarely budge in such a short time, unless the protests become violent, or the state protection services (police/military) are with the protesters.
  30. Regime change happens when basically every layer of society is largely in support of it, including the oligarchs, news media companies, some state officials, people in state security agencies and of course the public. Thats why ukrainian protests lead to revolution while the earlier duma election fraud protests in russia (not supported by oligarchs or by anyone meaningfully outside moscow) or later in belarus (suppressed thanks to the large state security apparatus as well as russian forces) didnt. I dont know how this situation look in serbia though
  31. Sometimes protests are enough, sometimes they're not.
  32. Unfortunately I have the impression that governments stopped caring about protest 20+ years ago. However, Serbia shows to never give up. They can fool some people some time, but they can't fool all the people all the time.
  33. Peaceful protest history washing. You won't change those in power as long as they hold power. No change was brought by benevolence of the oppressor.
  34. The problem with extended protests is that the regime has learned to work around it, and the situation has been normalized. By now, Vucic is probably profiting by seeling food and drinks to protesters. Dude ain't going by peace.
  35. They are to a point. When the government won‚Äôt step down the people need to step up. Escalate.
  36. No, protest are completely useless. In Catalonia we protested for 5 years for a referendum üòÇ. We never got a proper one.

Protest need to be done in the Euromaidan way. That works for sure.
  37. Peaceful protests don't change a thing in non-democratic countries...
  39. For as long as humans have existed there has been only one cost for freedom.

I hate to say it but cardboard signs, fireworks/flares and marching/chanting is not the cost of freedom.
  40. The French Revolution took 10 years and 6 months.¬†

Societal change can take time, particularly under tyranny.¬†
  41. We've seen plenty of protests turn into revolutions in recent years. I think the issue here might be that while a certain portion of Serbian society is protesting another equal if not a larger portion is made up of committed regime supporters.
  42. Better the elections
  43. The government institutions shitting themselves are tangible results.

PUMPAJ!
  44. The people in charge won't do shit unless you're actively affecting their life negatively. Peaceful protests do not.
  45. Protests take time, persistence builds pressure. Change isn‚Äôt instant, but it starts there.
  46. Protests are not enough in itself. The goal should be to win the sympathy of military forces and law enforcement over. Very few protests lead to successful regime change. Russian revolution happened after losing a war (or two in succession depending on time frame) and military personnel being fed up by the incompetent management from the Tsar and the Boyars. 

Ukraine‚Äôs Maidan was successful because protesters were highly organized and when police started violence the protesters fought back in a very organized, cohesive and goal directed way. They had huge support in armed forces. 

French revolutions were highly organized factions competing for hegemony when economic circumstances changed power relations. 

All of them used nationalism and populism to fuel support. Protests were a symptom.
  47. A general strike that halts the country and approximately 3.5% of the population participating is what normally leads to meaningful change, according to Dr Erica Chenoweth.
  48. The Ukrainian Euromaidan protests lasted 3+ months before Yanukovych was removed from the presidency. It was a stalemate for quite some time, but keeping the pressure up will result in inevitable change.
  49. Peaceful protest can only get you so far. This has been proven thoroughly history time after time.

I‚Äôm afraid, things will only change with riots. If the people above aren‚Äôt afraid of the people below, nothing will change.
  50. You want a regime change with peaceful protest? The existing regime needs to have some degree of integrity and respect for the people for that to work.
  51. Typically, peaceful protests in a ‚Äòregime environment‚Äô have little effect in the context of ‚Äòprotesting‚Äô. Authoritarian leaders don‚Äôt care what the masses think and are not swayed by protest. They have thick skin, so to speak. What protesting does do is unify the masses, and focuses the dissatisfaction. But more importantly, it shows the ‚Äòrest‚Äô of the world the peoples‚Äô dissatisfaction with the leader. Brings attention to a potential problem. Now, if other world leaders see the potential problem adversely affecting them, it is the actions of other world leaders that spark change in the country where protests are happening, by diplomatic means and conversations. Of course, revolutions always spark some form of change, not always for the better, and not always successful!
  52. Not really.  There are protest in cities all across the US and Trump will remain in office
  53. Sometimes it is, sometimes it takes a lot more than massive peaceful protests. See the French revolution, they couldn't have accomplished all that peacefully.
  54. It only matters in coutnries with proper checks on the president/PM's. The thing these petty authoritarians realized is that as long as you have loyalists in the police, media and the army what people do or how much they protest doesn't matter because you can outlast them. 

Developing Democracies need to come up with new ways to counter authoritarian backsliding because Peaceful protests don't cut it! 

Source: am Georgian.
  55. Not in an authoritarian regime, no. In a democracy yes.

In fact I saw recent research that says only 3.5% of the population needs to protest for it to be effective and the most effective version of that is a general strike.

But, caveat, when the regime controls all institutions and can use force to resist, it doesn‚Äôt work.¬†

  57. Directly? No. A peaceful protest only has an effect in a real Democracy. An authoritarian can sit out any peaceful action forever. It's not useless but you are basically bait, you hope the Dictator oversteps and truly whips society into a real, and this time very much not peaceful, fury. This is what happened with Euromaidan as well as basically any uprising in history.  
Sometimes it can work but in most cases the threat of mass violence was very much in the air already and the autocrat in question was not willing to live the rest of his live as a tyrant or is already some form or reformer (USSR breakup).
  58. Seems that no. Belarus and Georgia had long mass protest period too. Governments simply did not budge and that was it.
  59. In democracies, yes. In autocracies, no.
  60. Completely missed the Arabic spring?
  61. France had some success with the guillotine.
  62. Protests are important to cultivate the feeling of unity. Because every dictatorship‚Äôs primary goal is to atomize the society and make you think that you‚Äôre alone in your belief
  63. It took years of public demonstrations to bring Milosevic down. These blockades have an effect, its not radical but public opinion is shifting for sure.
  64. peaceful protest being effective is a lie sold to you by the ruling class to keep you docile and busy.
  65. "peaceful protests don't do shit, if you protest peacefully, they're [police] gonna beat us up or if you protest violently, they're gonna beat us up, so they were like "fuck it" and started throwing molotovs at the parliament building" -gattsu, on georgian protests
  66. Depends on the method of protest and the method of governement.
  67. Only when you storm the goddam parliament
  68. lol no. they make good headlines tho
  69. [Overall, nonviolent campaigns were twice as likely to succeed as violent campaigns: they led to political change 53% of the time compared to 26% for the violent protests.](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
  70. No, not any longer.

Peaceful protests lost their strength because the lessons dictators learned is to always wait them out. Because protestors are ADAMANT about the moral high ground of "no violence under any circumstances", waiting them out is easy. After all if you don't do anything as a dictator, you are basically guaranteed to win.

Few people want to hear it but: the reason peaceful revolutions worked was because dictators realized what a violent revolution would mean to them and their families. "Giving in to the demands and stepping" down needs to be the preferably option compared to "not giving in and waiting it out". But right now that's not the case. There is no incentive for dictators to step down, because there is no risk to them, their allies and their families if they don't.

Reminder that the last successful revolution on European ground, the Ukrainian Maidan was ANYTHING but a peaceful affair.

As long as protestors consider violence an absolute taboo and would rather see their own movement dissolved than taking the risk of a Civil War, then the protestors have already lost.

After a number of violent uprisings resulted in entire dictatorial dynasties being massacred down to the last member, THEN peaceful protests will regain their strength because there is now the sword of "or else" hanging over their necks.
  71. No. Unfortunately.  For a meaningful change we probably just need an asteroid to wipe out 98% of humanity.. 

Otherwise you protest, nothing changes, then when you stop the people in charge make new laws that made it a criminal offence,  and slam you in prison. 

Look at Hong Kong for instance. Or Turkey.
  72. Peaceful protest is like one of the first trouble-shooting step along with voting. Just like you don't start out fixing something by demolishing it, you don't start out addressing political or societal issues with violence.
  73. I wonder if OP, who didn't post anything for months and then asked the exact same question twice about turkye and serbia within 1 hour, might have ulterior motivesü§îü§îü§î

  76. Ukrainians kicked out their pro-russian president Yanukovich in 2014 so yes protests can change the regime.
  77. Yes and no.. depends on the country and conditions.. latest mass protest that ousted a government I can remember is Bangladesh, Sri Lanka. Can‚Äôt forget the Arabic spring..

But sometimes mass protest does not immediately lead to change.. I‚Äôm looking at French mob, protest.. anti trump protest‚Ä¶

But at the very least, it signals to the government that people are pissed. And governments tend to do two things, affect change or crack downs.

But governments and people need to remember. If you make peaceful resolutions impossible, you make violent revolutions inevitable.
  78. No regime ever changed through protest, they changed through revolution and civil war

Protests are a release valve on a boiler
  79. Not without support of the military, the police or some other armed agency. Regimes rarely fall on their own without some kind of internal pressure at the top.
  80. Peaceful protest dont work on fascists who dont care about democracy. We are rooting for you serbia, stay strong and pull through.
  81. Its been a month in Turkey and I'm already tired of protesting. How do you guys even keep going?
  82. Protests are just to see if people disagree.

Elections are to see how divided is society.

If you want changes you need to take control!
  83. Almost like protest aren‚Äôt some magic problem solver that Europeans think it is .
  84. Not by themselves, no
  85. It worked for Egypt before... until it didn't
  86. Depending on size of the protesting crowd, you're effectively shutting down a vast portion of a country and while that wont have an effect tomorrow - long term its the kind of thing that wrecks a government. Remember the Suez blockade and how it caused a good six months of inflation and price bs globally? Its the same deal, just with protests its a weapon, the suez was an accident.

It also creates fertile grounds for higher ups to stage coups or stage themselves as the better choice etc. Theres a lot going on out of view, because its secret or because news media aren't really privy to new movements coming up or care about how people get on. The Franz Ferdinan assassination was conducted by anarchists who became prepared for violence after massive austerity - the Bolshevik movement also sort of just "happened" etc. etc. When the dust settles there'll be a lot more information.
  87. Euromaidan started in 2013 and, in effect, continues to this day.  –°–ª–æ–±–æ–¥–∞ —Å–µ —É–∑–∏–º–∞, –Ω–µ –¥–∞—ò–µ. –ù–∏–∫–∞–¥ —Å–µ –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞—ò.
  88. AMERICANS! Take notice!
  89. Greetings. Protests showed much how brave Serbian people are against the corrupt and spoiled political system of Vucic, how insisting they are, and ready to struggle for a more fair society.
What the protests achieved... hmmm, frankly saying, not very much. Why?
1. No POLITICAL demands. System cannot be changed without that
2. No full UNITY OR COORDINATION between students, opposition parties, social groups. Nobody could go far without that
3. Not enough pressure to achieve the goals - crossroads blockades, prolonged strikes, I mean 15-20 days, not 1, not 2 days.
4. Not enough external support. And here is what the Democratic society, the EU countries owes to you!
Keep on fighting, guys! We stand with you! And always know - the most expensive, precious, desired thing in that God damned world is THE LIBERTY! üóΩüóΩüóΩ DO NOT GIVE UP AND BETRAY YOUR IDEALS, YOUR FUTURE!
  90. You forgot to account for the fact that nothing ever happens
  91. Sometimes it's the only thing you can do
  92. Could somebody explain me what is going on on Serbia?
  93. Protests mean that, even if you lose, nobody can tell everyone that you went silently or that you wanted what was happening. There will be physical, bloody proof that you didn't want it. That makes a difference to the Next Generation that might be trapped under that regime.
  94. Stay strong Serbia! You will beat this!
  95. Euromaidan was pretty successful.
  96. Vote for far right or any extreme and this is the result. Protest work on government that care a bit, far right it's never the case.

Without fear for their properties or live far right government will never be affected by protest.
  97. Non
  98. I wouldn‚Äôt say no change has happened, stuff has been going on, they just have yet to get rid of the president yet

But as I understand it they have been organising a lot of civilian assemblies which are starting to make some changes

If this is a revolution, it‚Äôs a slow burner, but stuff is happening
  99. Serbia, T√ºrkiye, USA, Georgia, and Hungary right now across the globe united by a cause of removing authoritarian government regimes.
  100. Didn‚Äôt ever work for us in Venezuela
  101. Romania managed it pretty handily. Difficult to argue with their result.
  102. It wasn‚Äôt protesting that took down the Assad regime.
  103. Ukrainian here - yes, they are effective when they stop being peaceful. No authoritarian dictator has left because of peaceful protests.
  104. The sad reality is that these protests need to be violent to change a regime. The peaceful only work for policy changes üòÇü•±
  105. This might illustrate the difference between a protest and a demonstration. A protest says ‚Äúa lot of us don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù  A demonstration demonstrates the ability and willingness of the people to fuck up the ruling class. A demonstration is a little destructive and a little scary for the ruling class. A protest can just be ignored.
  106. What was supposed to change? If they just walk the streets and dance, how does that affect the dictator? I would understand if they surrounded his residence and danced around it, maybe they would spoil his appetite that way. I think the concept of non-violent protest has been distorted lately. Because now it is a party, whereas in Gandhi's time it was an action of mass civil disobedience. Both now and then there was no violence on the part of the protesters, but in Gandhi's time there was at least a disregard and bycott for laws that most people disagreed with.
  107. No.

Next question.
  108. No, **direct action is required.**
  109. OP, are you serious? While it‚Äôs easy to feel frustrated by a lack of immediate results, history shows that mass protests have often been a decisive factor in bringing about regime change or major political reforms‚Ä¶ 

Even if the process is slow or meets setbacks:
	‚Ä¢	Tunisia‚Äôs Jasmine Revolution (2011): Persistent protests forced President Ben Ali to step down after 23 years, leading to the first democratic elections in the country‚Äôs history and a new constitution.
	‚Ä¢	Egypt‚Äôs January 25 Revolution (2011): Weeks of mass mobilization led to the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak after nearly 30 years in power.
	‚Ä¢	Malawi (2020): Months of civil society-led protests led to a historic rerun of a flawed election and the ousting of the ruling party.
	‚Ä¢	Peru (2020): Massive protests forced the resignation of an interim president after just five days in office.
  110. It seems that only violent protests are effective.
  111. You need to make it like Maidan
  112. If the protesters were armed then probably yes.
  113. Effective and longlasting changes happened in the mindset of the population, breaking the fear of Vucic and his loyalist. Forever erasing the inter-ethnic hate speeches... Muslim and Christian students welcoming one another in their respective cities like brothers and sisters, hearing the speech of an serbian (orthodox) war veteran from the war in Bosnia welcoming muslim students when they arrived in Belgrade saying : "There will be no more their children vs our children.. from now on, there is only OUR children, they all are our children. "

These students are a nightmare for the nationalists and extremists the change is deep because they are not changing the regimes leader, but the whole society.
  115. sadly they may have to copy the ukranians to get results
  116. Watch the movie 'Winter on Fire' - this is about the Maidan protests in Ukraine in 2013 which led to their Russian puppet leader to run with his tail between his legs back to Russia.


Ukrainians got their country and democracy back after months of protesting. It's worth a watch and is very inspiring as a protester.
  117. Peaceful protests? No, no they aren't, except in very rare cases. Violent ones on the other hand...
  118. I hate to say it, but... Only when they're violent. Because with these regimes, Russia, and fascism in general; the only language they understand is violence. They're gonna come down on you harder than you could ever hurt them, so the only way to remove them from office is to forcefully kick them out. Standing in the street for a few years isn't going to change anything but give you a nasty cold. A peaceful protest is exactly what they want, because at least they can ignore it and continue doing what they're doing without any REAL pushback. Yes it's illegal, but the law isn't a moral compass and certainly not a law designed and enforced by the regime you're against.
  119. No, protests are only useful in regimes that bother to listen to citizens in the first place. If regime gives you the middle finger, or police brutality, you will get hurt, or killed, and no change will happen.

Even violent protests mostly accomplish nothing, even if you topple the country in civil war and manage regime change, the new regime will very likely be more of the same.

Politics suck.
  120. No but revolutions are
  121. Protesters need to escalate if they want to see changes. Start occupying governmental buildings. Or at least permanently surrounding them. Tents and long term structures near the protest areas with volunteers sharing food and places to sleep. Just sharing what was done during Maidan in Ukraine 2013-2104. Government decided to ignore the protests, so it is either escalation, or people will tire out. That is an actual tactic for this kind of regimes. Or you pray and wait until next election and hope it won‚Äôt be rigged to much.
  122. %3.5 rule
  123. 1 word: no. Peaceful protests won't do shit.
  124. No. Only revolutions can change that sadly. We did that in 1989 when we shot the dictator Ceau»ôescu.
  125. One mistake is believing that because "nothing" has been achieved... then protests are not useful.


This is not how things work. Protests are necessary, but not sufficient. Without protests, other actions can be less effective, many political problems must be attacked on many fronts at the same time.
  126. Yes, it did change Poland. There were massive protests in 1980 and many other earlier protests. It finally had led to a communism being overthrown in 1989. But we had a martial law inbefore and a total colapse of already uneffcient economy. So it is possible, but it takes a lot of time.
  127. No they‚Äôre not. It makes zero sense to me.People in power are psychopaths and will never change their minds
  129. They are not, revolution is.
  130. They're effective if there's a political opponent that will cash the protests in. If there isn't one, one should be created.
  131. It will take time, but it‚Äôll happen..
  132. This is going to be a tough thing for some people to come to terms with but unless the police/military join your side, there's no threat to the government in staying in power. It's why when violence is a part of the protest governments listening more carefully because they are forced to listen. Peaceful protests are great and in a perfect world they would work but when leaders think themselves dictators then at least the real threat of a coup makes a big difference.
  133. Sounds like the next phase would be a general strike.
  134. No, unfortunately I don't think protests can do anything any more. Politicians learned that mass protests die down eventually, and it's always easier to wait it out or just send in the police. Unless the protest is combined with country-wide, crippling strikes and/or turn violent, there is 0 chance of achieving anything with them.

See what happened in Venezuela or T√ºrkye - nothing, despite literally the whole country protesting.
  135. Go away Serbian government, nice fucking try making us all think protests and rebellion is pointless!
  136. Yes but they are best when they have an agenda or focus. Raw anger isn't productive.
  137. Compared to the old-fashioned ways? No. There are no consequences to the pressing side without resulting in violence. Nobody pays attention to the beggar without a gun.
  138. They had a massive one march 15 and apparently there's one today. Other than that they have not been massive at all.¬† More¬† drastic, consistent PEACEFUL, measures are needed if being heard is the outcome.
  139. Why did it work in Ukrain?
  140. The Solidarity movement protests in Poland took years to have an effect but it definitely ended up making a huge difference and they lead to the collapse of the communist regime in Poland.They want you to give up. Stay strong Serbia! 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)
  141. Gambia has removed a dictator like that
  142. Stop thinking like that, that's what regime wants, KEEP PROTESTING
  143. Protests are super effective! Look at the Bulldozer Revolution. Many Serbs were deeply unhappy with the Milo≈°eviƒá regime and its propaganda, economic incompetence, and undemocratic rule. They protested, the government fell, Serbs celebrated.

Then Milo≈°eviƒá's propaganda minister started a new party, and Serbs voted for him.

Now Serbs are protesting against Milo≈°eviƒá's propaganda minister, his control of the media, economic incompetence, and undemocratic rule.

Eventually the current government will fall. *What will people choose after that*?
  144. I think the real question is what else can citizens do to show their discontent?
  145. Well, you have the various color revolutions, Indian apartheid, African apartheid, the civil rights movement, and Egypt's revolution. Peacful protests not working are propaganda against the effectiveness of protests. It's also not really a good idea to ignore peaceful protests because given enough time they do you stay peaceful
  146. Well - it‚Äôs hard to achieve anything if the government is popular. And this one - as bad as it is - is popular. The massive size of protests may not give the correct picture, it‚Äôs bigger urban crowds, also protests getting trendy and instagrammable - but same people posing may not be active voters. The periphery is overwhelmingly pro-Vuƒçiƒá. I bet if they held proper, free, controlled by outside observers election Vuƒçiƒá would win. I may be wrong here, my experience from which I draw this conclusion is limited, but I would bet 50‚Ç¨ on it. :)
  147. In eastern countries that are very corrupted like serbia bulgaria romania etc no peacefully protests are not enough, they just don‚Äôt give a f, the state is so corrupted, everyone is bought, they jusy don‚Äôt care, you will get tired to protest in the street while they smoke cigars and drink expensive whiskey looking and laughing at you.
  148. When peaceful protests don't work. Ask the French what to do.
  149. The point of a demonstration isn't to convince the leader to step down. The point is to *demonstrate* that the leader has no public support. This can then be used as an argument by the people on whom the leader relies, to stop supporting them.

This happened to Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá on 5 October 2000, when army commanders refused to support him after months of protests. (Not an expert on Serbian history though, I just dive in Wikipedia rabbit holes sometimes.)
  150. We will continue, and never give up
  151. It seems in the current World order peacefull protests are kind of ineffective, if your are already in a autocracy. We have seen protests in serbia, georgia and Turkey, but nothing seemingly changed for now with many opposition leader even in prison
  152. The prime minister resigned - no change?!?!
  153. Overemphasizing that protests are peaceful doesn't scare politicians. It turns them into a form of virtue signaling
  154. Heartbroken to say : I don't think so anymore
  155. Protests don't really do much, ever, except for a way for the people to vent. It is rare that a protest actually brings about change.
  156. The protests have been effective at pissing the government off and invoking more critical thinking among the population. However, singing, dancing wont cause any major change. Blocking RTS was successful because it obstructed their modus operandi. If more buildings, that are essential to the regime that is, are blocked then they‚Äôd be in a pickle.
But for now, the regime has full support from the EU and Russia, and external pressures are rising
  157. No
  158. Why is the coat of arms not on that flag?
  159. The key thign for regime change is the security services flippikg sides
As long as the security service remains loyal to the regime, the regime stands. If they switch and stand aside as happened during the earlier bulldozer revolution in Serbia, the regime won't last
  160. Fear is the only catalyst for change when it comes to authoritarians and dictators because that‚Äôs how they control the masses. Unless they fear for their lives, protests won‚Äôt achieve anything. They will continue to apply the fear tactics through arrests and torture as the protests dwindle into nothing.
  161. Take Romania as an example of how to deal with dictators and how to effect a regime change‚Ä¶
  162. They should like switch government while their president is attending the orc festivities in May and just not let him back in the country.

Will not happen, but it would be nice. 
I don't think a peaceful protest is effective, but if it gets violent they will just get russian mercenaries to beat down and torture the civilians. 
So...yeah, I don't know. The world is strange.
  163. The entire government resigned (obv doesnt metter too much since one man is governing all)? Institutions are slowly stoping their loyalty to dictator-wannabe. Awareness is rising.
However it is hard to fight this fight of atrition while dictator-wannabe is being supported by eu, us, china and russia at the same time...
  164. Protests aren't really effective at anything in my opinion.... if you want political change, get involved in the political process, not shouting from the streets.
  165. Well...

If you're literally doing nothing but holding up a little handpainted sign for an hour or two then go back to your normal day to day life with no changes and nothing else... then no, it's quite useless.

You would actually have to do something.
  166. Unless the armed forces come out in support then there's little to no chance the current government will step aside.
  167. Took 14 years in Syria
  168. The sdr in Germany would like to have a talk
  169. in India anti corruption protest went nearly 2 years and a strong opposition and its huge ass advertising was responsible for regime change although we were democracy then
  170. Honestly they should just bring back the serbian monarchy to have someone capable of dismissing corrupt goverments.
  172. No, they‚Äôre not. That‚Äôs why the left is a joke.
  173. That is Not the Serbian flag
  174. No they're not. It's why protesting is constantly pushed as "the only way!!"
  175. Stay strong Serbia!
  176. Yes
  177. It worked in Bangladesh
  178. Martin Luther King knew, ‚Äúyou have to hit them in the pockets.‚Äù
  179. I'm not all that convinced that protests ever really achieve much if anything beyond simple exposure tbh.
  180. Keep it up, Serbia! 160 days is a long time
  181. From statistics... No they aren't.
  182. no
  183. Authoritarian regimes do not change without protests. They are a representation of public support being lost, something lethal to any government. They are necessary and effective, but only so long as the pressure continues.
  184. What about the Georgians and their protesting streek? They've been having unrests since the last elections and the Foreign Agents law but the government hasn't ceded and nothing has changed so far, regarding from a foreigner's perspective.
  185. No, they are not without a plan for political change. If protest is wide, without political organisation capable to lead and create poltical articulation of requests in form of lawsC government proposal, or win at elections, protests will eventually start to lose energy and will lead to political depression.
  186. It's a game of chicken. See who buckles first.
  187. Not peaceful ones.
  188. I am Romanian so... I've got an idea, but... It's risky
  189. I applaud their steadfast action for change. But, 6 months is a very long time to also be completely ignored. What if the government just doesnt care and for  all they care they do this for 2 more years?

Can this at some point escalate to for example civil war? Or how does it work when peaceful protests dont work?
  190. Nope. They have built their corrupt empires in decades and it will take decades to make big changes and unfortunately I think the spark with these kind of people can only be violence. I'm not advocating for violence but these corrupt thieves with ties to the crime world do not give a shit about protests and the people, they will only be kicked out by force, like it has almost always happened throughout history. And this applies to many other countries, not just Serbia. Why would a rich corrupt politician who has protection from the law, has friends and influence in all important structures of a state (justice system , police, etc) and protection from criminals ever say "oh yes I'm sorry for being a piece of shit, I ruined the future for enough people and stole enough from this country, I'll stop now, my bad"?. These kind of people have no empathy, no honor, no moral compass to begin with. 
If this was like 30 years ago they would have used violence themselves against the protesters but now they have to keep up appearances at least so they let them yell in the streets and maybe pretend to care and do something like change one corrupt official with another or replace some high political figure with another one from their circle.
  191. Short answer is no. Longer answer is that only violent protest can change regimes.
  192. Here's a truth pill that is going to be really hard for you guys to swallow: Peaceful protests only ever succeeded in the past because of US support for freedom and democracy around the world.

Now that the US is just another Russia, there's no real pressure on authoritarian regimes to behave better. Only civil war can bring about regime change now.
  193. What did they do in Arab spring? They at least got rid of some bad leaders even if the aftermath has been as it has been.
  194. In an authoritarian country, people's protests are either scorned or harshly repressed. Demonstrations only have an effect in democracies or when the regime is already dying. 


See Iran, China, Russia among others. The Syrian regime fell in 2 weeks, for Turkey, it may be about to change.

On the other hand, for the USA, the Trump regime is so new and caricatured that it can only lead to serious unrest. Good luck to the US people and to the democratic states of the planet.
  195. Turkey is in a similar situation. Let's see what happens.
  196. It's because they have no idea what's next. They are against something, but for nothing / people in the crowd want different things. There is no leader or clear vision forward
  197. No.
  198. No but reddit won't let you have honest conversation about a hard subject without catching a ban.
  199. no.
  200. A peaceful protest has never in the history of mankind accomplished anything of significance

  1. The Albania-Greece vote swap is pretty remarkable considering how much we vilify each other
  2. I don't get it, so nobody voted for the winner?
  3. Poles are the largest ethnic minority in both  Ireland and Iceland.
  4. Albania-Greece brotherhood trancends politics.
  5. Eurovision 2025: ~~United by Music~~ What the Hell just happened?
  6. You get 20 votes per credit card, which can all go to the same act.
  7. People who vote politically and are pro-Israel have one option. People who vote politically and are not pro-Israel have 25 options. Even if the pro-Israel voters are in the minority, the other side just spreads out a lot more
  8. You mean to tell me Eurovision is political and rigged? I don‚Äôt believe it. Since when?
  9. Isn't it very weird that the country that "won" the public vote is not even in the top 10 of most streamed songs by daily streams? [source](https://x.com/esc_charts/status/1923915220541481400?t=Bv9We59_LACXW4f_4jqsiQ&s=19)
  10. Maybe not use a voting system that can be corrupted by a simple auto-dialler going forward?
  11. proud of us Slovenians, once for a change üëèüèΩ
  12. Lol, no f-ing way
  13. This is what happens when there is no negative vote. Something controversial (politically) sweeps the 12s because its supporters all vote for it, while its haters vote for dozens of songs, which means Israel ends with the most votes over the other songs individually.
  14. Wow, a poilitical decision, instead of one based on the actual performance? Eurovision would never!
  15. There is no way Spanish people voted for Israel so much. Something doesn't seem right
  16. The elephant in the room aside, Serbia and Croatia finally agreeing on something that's also actually genuinely based is nice to see. Nice to see Armenians being people of culture as well
  17. Portugal gave 12pts do Israel?
Nah, I don't buy it
  18. It's not a huge priority for Eurovision to prevent gaming of the voting system, for regular users it is enough to make it require a bit of extra work.   
  
All you need is VPN + credit card and you can vote "locally" anywhere.  A million votes requires a mere 1,5 M‚Ç¨ "marketing budget". GG.

Thank god the expert juries gave enough points to Austria to prevent the Israeli psyop piece winning.
  19. Considering the mood in the arena during Israel‚Äòs performance, I‚Äôm honestly surprised. I thought they‚Äôd score last.
  20. 20 trillion eurovision points to israel
  21. Not a surprise when the Israeli government advertising agency spends millions on ads begging other countries to vote for poor victim Israel. It's pathetic and disgusting and we all knew this was going to happen. Why bother voting if Israel wins the televote no matter the song they send? Israel needs to be banned from the contest as this ruins the entire show for everyone.
  22. Here is the evidence of the fraud :

  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/1kopxce/youtube\_advertisement\_to\_vote\_for\_israel\_in\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/1kopxce/youtube_advertisement_to_vote_for_israel_in_the/)



People posting screenshots of vote maniupulation.

  
\+ Comment Bot-farms in China.

  
\+ Poland did require face ID for the Televote = different result !

  
\+ Statistical irregularity of the Televote.
  23. The Israel vote from Sweden is "rigged" we got bombarded with ads where we should vote for them (all 20) for weeks before the finals
  24. I'm sorry but I just don't believe that so many people were voting for Israel.
  25. The irony of excluding Russia but supporting Israel.
  26. stopped watching after Europapa debacle. Turns out to be just another shitshow
  27. Breaking news political thing is political
  28. Wonder how much traffic was going through VPNs during voting time
  29. Televoting in the era of AI, Musk, etc., means the ‚Äúvoting,‚Äù bears absolutely zero resemblance to reality. Hopefully these kinds of events will sink into irrelevance within the next few years. Euphoria was the last major chart hit to come out of that pageant. ABBA and Celine Dion are the only two truly internationally recognised acts to ever come out of it.
  30. Hey, maybe don't let people vote 20 times if you don't want Evangelicals to rig the vote
  31. Im Very suprised by spain as they were thretened to be fined by EBU for bringing to attention the Genocide in Gaza
  32. Is Azerbaijan voting for Israel not extremely weird?
  33. Embarrassing.
  34. Made even more obvious with a map.
  35. If not because of Gaza, Israel should have been banned for their blatant manupulation that goes against the spirit of the competition. But they also made sure that wouldn't happen with their sponsorships (Moroccanoil is Israeli).
  36. We will allow all countries to run lots of YouTube ads next year?
  37. rigged. move on.
  38. I love how people are complaining about how political Eurovision is while everyone has been trying to make Eurovision political for the last 2 years because of Israel. You got what you wanted hahaha. Eurovision should be a song contest not a symbol for what political opinion is popular.
  39. I don‚Äôt believe those many people likes the israeli singer. Same as last year, the televote is so high for them and exceptionally high compared to judges vote when that is not normal for any other country
  40. I thought Israel and Australia voted for Greece?
  41. I didnt watch it this year only because of this. The same shit happened last year. Ive been following eurovision for over a decade. If russia is disqualified why cant israel too? Im never gonna watch eurovision again if israel still competes. Its not even an european country.
  42. Israel -> Ukraine -> Lithuania -> Latvia -> Estonia -> Sweden -> Israel
  43. Humiliation ritual
  44. Why does the map show Czechoslovakia? That country hasn‚Äôt existed in decades!
  45. They should scrap the whole thing it so corrupted. A country not even in Europe getting all those votes. Never mind the genocide they cause.
  47. I am ashamed and astonished the UK gave Israel 12 points. The song wasn't even any good.
  48. Lol they aren't even trying to be discreet about it
  49. Sus
  50. Oh, the smell of genocide and neo-colonialism.
  51. Either it was manipulated or the public are a bunch of c***s, either/both could be true.

But if you think about it and you assume 1 in 20 people were politically motivated to vote for the genocidal maniac country and the rest just spread their vote around, its easy to see how we get results like this.
  52. Did austria won 1 st place once?
  53. Well, well, well, nothing suspicious here, am I right?
  54. Hiw us israel in europe?
  55. For once proud of my country
  56. Reddit discovering that people outside of reddit don't all share their opinions and trying to rationalize it is always funny to see.
  58. People still watch this absolute shit?
  59. I posted this in another thread but thought I'd post it here too for the people who are trying to understand the vote for Israel.  

I don't think it was "rigging" or  an ad campaign like so many people are saying. I know that no ad could make me voluntarily spend my own money to vote for a Eurovision song. 

I think it's more that Yuval (the singer for Israel) had the most passionate fans. I lived in Israel for more than a decade but have lived in Europe for 5+ years and plan to stay here. Israel has always been very intense about Eurovision-- I think a win means a lot more to Israel than it does to most countries who just see it as a fun song contest.  Israel has always gravitated toward serious ballads that somehow tell the Israeli story-- for example one of my favorite entries was when Palestinian singer Mira Awad and Israeli singer Achinoam Nini sang "There must be another way" together in English, Arabic, and Hebrew. (This year the runner up in the contest to choose a Eurovision entry was actually an Israeli Arab.) To Israelis a vote always feels like "the world cares about us, understands us,  and supports us," even though I think to most of the world it's not that deep. Israel almost never enters humorous songs so it was almost a shock to the Israeli mentality when Netta won a few years back with a fun banger-- I think Israel didn't know what to think! 

I've watched Eurovision for years on and off but never bothered to vote until last year. Living abroad, voting gave me a chance to show support for the Israeli people,  especially because we could see how much hate Eden was getting.  The song last year was originally entitled "October Rain" and basically told the story of how bereft we were feeling after the horror of Oct 7. Last year Israel was almost complete iced out by the judges,  which made it feel even more meaningful when the audience vote put Eden pretty high in the rankings. 

This year I felt less intense about supporting Israel in the voting than I did last year (and actually split my votes between Israel and a bunch of other countries), but I was still reminding friends and family to vote for Yuval and spent my own money to vote for only the second time ever. This singer was a survivor of the Nova massacre who literally had to hide under dead bodies for hours on Oct. 7. She seems like such a sweet, warm soul and her song told the story of this resilience. It is also objectively a really good song sung beautifully.  I've been listening to it on repeat since it came out (though maybe I'm not a great judge of what would objectively do well in Eurovision bc I also voted for Switzerland and the UK-- and in my opinion Estonia should have won,  we gave him multiple votes). 

I also breathed a huge sigh of relief when Israel didn't win-- honestly nobody needs the drama of Israel hosting Eurovision right now!! I just wanted to support Yuval and see her finish well,  like Eden last year.  

Another factor is that for obvious reasons a LOT more Israelis moved out of the country to Europe since Oct 7. One secret to doing well in Eurovision seems to be to have something so awful happen in your country that a lot of your people leave and become potential Eurovision votes.  :-p Voters in the country where I live gave our 12 points to Ukraine, because we have a ton of Ukrainian refugees here.  

Tl;dr I don't think there is really anything deeper going on here than that Israeli fans were really motivated to get out the vote and show support. Call YOUR friends and family to vote for your favorites next year!
  60. Grim AF
  61. I hate this
  62. Germany is overcorrecting so much
  64. nauseating
  65. When will people realise the simple fact that there are a LOT of people who support Israel and begin to realise that protestors and internet echo-chambers are the small but vocal minority.

And that makes me happy.
  66. This will definitely help the perception of Israel. Probably need the /s
  67. I'm kind of asking myself if the external ads for israels song where sufficient for this effect.
  68. Can anyone claiming its rigged/stolen link any evidence? I understand some countries promote theirs songs more than others but how is the voting itself rigged?
  69. Congratulations to Yuval. üôÇ
  70. It is never about music, it is always about politics.

This year, the message is "genocide = good".
  71. "If I speak, I am in big trouble"
  73. Europe is cooked
  74. Ugggghhhhh
  75. Am I the only wondering why Israel even goes to this?
  76. Aww tiny cutie Aus
  78. heartwarming honestly
  79. That‚Äôs bullshit. Portugal gave the 12 points to Italy.
  80. Shit gotta be fake asf üò≠ cuz ain‚Äôt no WAY, someone explain to me how the voting system works I genuinely refuse to believe it. Can people buy votes?
  81. western europe is a circus
  82. Every country where there is a strong israeli lobby lol
  83. Skrupellose Europ√§er in 2025: "Wir haben es gewusst und trotzdem enthusiastisch zugeschaut"
  84. I don't understand, the israelian song was really good, without any political consideration
  85. Eurovision has become shit show or maybe it was always a shit show and I realize it late as I was a kid.
  86. Half Europe is braindead then?
  87. Redditors shocked to learn that they live in echo-chamber, and average Gabriel, Joe and Manuel don't consider that Israel at fault cause they are defending from terrorist state  (which Gaza is, they elected HAMAS) that attacked them first
  88. Asskissers
  89. Oh I love seeing reddit meltdown over Israel getting top points from all over the world. Everything is so different outside the reddit echo chamber.
  90. Just let ChatGPT vote.
  91. It's the way people express that they're fed up with the mass migration of Islamist foreigners.
  92. Hasbara in action
  93. Their islamofobia will murder more people than save the Democracy
  94. Europe supports Israel! üáÆüá±ü´∂üèª‚òÆÔ∏è
  95. Wait, you guys are watching Eurovision?
  96. Why is it political though? Why do countries (and their politicians) give so much of a dam about winning a singing contest? It's just singing. It doesn't mean anything

Lol getting down voted for asking why a singing contest is so important to politics. It's singing guys. Get over it
  97. Wow a lot of mad redditors rn üëÄ
  98. Damn people really upset seeing jews win
  99. Ah eurovision, by tomorrow everyone will have forgotten and the winning singers hardly get to be succesful with the odd exception here and there. A waste of money and ressources
  100. Ukraine and Israel need to be invited as guest, otherwise the televote will always be political like this.
  101. Was the Israeli performance good? I didn't watch it. But please honest reviews
  102. Oh no, rigged. Was the Switzerland song last year choice of people? Lol. I actually hope Israel wins it once, meltdown would be spectacular, this is what Eurovision is all about.
  106. üòÆFrom the river to the‚Ä¶. Seems that tune got forgotten quickly.
  107. We voted Israel just to see the world burn lol
  108. Wrong. Germany received 12 points from Ukraine.
  109. Forget about everything else, the Baltics are sus.

He, Orban , Weidel and the like can stay away from Europe.
  35. It would have been great if he could also have not participated in corruption :D  
To be clear, he was definitely arrested for political reasons. But he is also definitely legitimately guilty of at least some of the corruption charges.
  37. It's very nice that Asian politicians start to reach out to the Europe on Reddit.
  39. lol la git
  40. Pretty crazy that they are only in NATO as a geopolitical deterrent to Russia, while at the same time denying NATO is a force against Russia specifically, and denying Russia‚Äôs entrance to NATO. 

Makes you think a bit.

#Vladimir Putin's propagandists complain on TV that they can no longer take power in Romania peacefully after the Romanian presidential elections.


Russian propagandists complain on TV that they couldn't take power in Romania

After Nicu»ôor Dan's victory in the 2025 presidential election, Vladimir Putin's propagandists are complaining that they can no longer peacefully take power in Romania. It all happened during a show broadcast on Russian television.

One of the guests stated that "the events that took place in Bucharest showed that nothing can be done with them peacefully."

"What can be done with such European leadership? Unfortunately, the events that took place in Bucharest have shown that nothing can be done with them peacefully. The guys have completely compromised themselves. Liberal democracy has achieved a new victory.

"Not in the sense that the mayor of Bucharest was declared the winner, not in that sense, but in the sense that they have perfected the techniques to stay in power under any circumstances," said the guest on the set, during a show broadcast on Russian television.



Nicu»ôor Dan won the 2025 Romanian presidential election . The independent candidate obtained 53.60% of the vote, while his opponent had 46.40%. Nicu»ôor Dan's victory was commented on at the Kremlin on Monday.

On May 19, Dimitri Peskov said about the election of Nicu»ôor Dan as president of Romania that it was "strange at the very least", as reported by the Russian news agency TASS .

"We know the story of the candidate who had the best chances, who, without bothering to find any justification, was simply forcibly removed from the race. And in the absence of such a favourite candidate, whoever won won. This is the reality," the Kremlin spokesman said.

In April of this year, just weeks before the Romanian presidential election, it was revealed that Russia was modifying AI and Wikipedia with pro-Kremlin propaganda. With a very well-established network, developed over the past three years, they were modifying the content of Wikipedia articles, as well as data provided by artificial intelligence, with pro-Moscow messages.
  5. Thoughts and prayers for all that money wasted on propaganda.
  6. We should permanently close all European borders with Russia, big wall, military posts, minefields the whole enchalada, fuck off with Ruzzia
  7. Sounds like a threat.


WTF do they want with us? After 35 years we still have to deal with their kind and from election to election it seems like we're on the brink.
  8. these the same cretins that are then wondering why we became ‚Äúrussophobic‚Äù?
  9. Just so you know, a few months ago, all the Romanian subs were filled with people saying "Georgescu is not linked to Russia".
  10. And they still act surprised when realizing how many of us in Romania genuinely hate them. Like in real, passionate, hate!
  11. Russia is an aggressive cancer.
  12. I like how in real time they just say shit like this and I'm still crazy and terminally online for saying shit like "politicians are being bought by the Russian Government.".

Like can we do something about this before they make our lives shit by buying our ELECTED representative?
  13. As always, Russia is like, "I don't want peace. I want problems, ALWAYS!!"

Why are they like that? So absurdly hostile and evil??
  14. we wish for the same results for hungary with putin's dog orban gone for good next year. It looks good for us so far
  15. Romanians: Can you elect different president?

Russians: Yes! But Putin always wins!

Romanians: Then what is difference between Russia and North Korea?

Russians shocked, Romania rocks!
  16. What is that supposed to mean? Is it Romania gonna be the second Ukraine and how long until then?
  17. What the fuck is wrong with these people?
  18. And again they are confirming that they have no intentions of leaving other countries as they are. And even more important to stop the disease from Kreml spreading.
  19. What, taking all Romania's gold, relics, and artifacts wasn't enough? Now Russia needs their land, too?
  20. If putin isnt defeated soon, we‚Äôll have huge problems‚Ä¶ 

Edit: there is still a difference here for me. I dont want death or russians to starve. I want then to stop attacking nations every 8 years and ideally retreat from where they dint belong. I think its mostly their regime right now that needs to go.
  21. Imagine how Russia would act if the 'west' threatened them like they try to do to everyone else? 

I bet you'd see that dog's tail tuck so fucking quickly between it's shamed legs.
  22. I am kinda glad that they are openly talking shit about more countries now, not just the usual Ukraine, Georgia, Baltic states etc.¬†

This way, more people in the world can see how ridiculous their claims are.¬†

Therefore, they are less likely to fall for their talking points regarding their current imperialistic invasion.¬†
  23. Well if that doesn‚Äôt just signal to Moldova, I don‚Äôt know what does.
  24. When will the west wake the fuck up and cut Russia off from the rest of the world
  25. If the Russians want to fuck around, I bet there are plenty of people who would like to help them find out. We should also start fostering separatism in the hundreds of subjugated people groups in the Russian federation, it's important to get that going. How could Russia wage war if she had had 20 morally justified revolutionary movements on her own soil?
  26. Russia doesn't need to be taking power from anyone but Putin and his goon squads...out with the old...in with the new...
  27. They can come over for round 3 of ass whoopin if they haven‚Äôt had enough already. It‚Äôs no problem we got plenty more to give
  28. Peacefully.... so... that means they intend to take Romania one way or another.
  29. This is confirmation who the next target for a Russian invasion would be if they succeed in conquering Ukraine. There was too much speculation that that either the Baltic states or Poland were next, but know we know it‚Äôs Romania.
  30. Might be time for all of Europe to put the ruskies back to siberia once snd for all
  31. why would you ever trust a russian ?
  32. This should be seen by everyone to make them understand whose side these pro russian right wing politicians are on.
  33. Why's everyone so mean to us ü•∫...we...we just want to rule everything ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫.....but they're being so rude ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫üòûü•∫
  35. Whacky thing about Democracy, power is given, not taken.
  36. The time for abusing democracy seems to be passing. Now they only have a military solution left. Of course, provided they don't get stuck like in Ukraine. In the meantime, the EU could adopt rules on candidate reciprocity - as many pro-EU candidates as there are in the Russian elections, there can be as many pro-Russianin the EU elections.
  37. It's like they have an abusers mentality. "Oh you could've just let me have complete control over you but you said no so now I have to get violent and it's your fault.".
  38. I honestly blame our own institutions for completely sleeping over years of digital warfare. Its incredibly sad what can be achieved and the damage we suffered already is immense. Just look at HU and SVK. Pigs like this propagandist shouldn't really be able to achieve anything, yet, here we are. I would be schocked if elections without outside influence could be achieved in this decade.
  39. Aside from that whole failed coup attempt thing. Maybe you just suck and as a result you lost?
  40. So keep out!! It‚Äôs like Pinky and the Brain!!
  41. when I see this it reminds me of a Audiard's films "Les tontons flingueurs" : Assholes dare anything, that‚Äôs how you know them.
  42. Classic russian bullshit. Couldn't hate russia and their orcish people less, even if they turned into cute baby seals overnight.
  43. I understand the Russian's feelings. They paid for that election and then it was stolen from them.
  44. Aww poor guys. Sorry we had to do it to you. All that hard work insidiously trolling us on every possible channel, tv and internet, and all that money spent. I cry
  45. Why give them airtime at all?
  46. Looks like they will be going with plan B first which will be the "Trump". State the election was rigged and the pro Russian guy was really the one who won.

Then plan C which is "Have a special operation near the border of Romania"
  47. They need to focus on their 3rd world backwards-ass country and it's politics, revolt and rebuild.

They're not taking shit without consequence
  48. Jfc, they're insufferable! Russia is like that guy at school that pissed everyone off all the time but couldn't figure out why no one liked them.
  49. "Why oh why won't anyone think of the poor despot Putin who just wants to create a tyrannical empire..."
  50. Oh riiiigut! *Liberal Democracy*, or how we are used see it: *Voting without a guy holding a gun while we make our choice*
  51. America tolerates this kind of behavior because they know that if the world gets rid of Russia then they are next.
  52. You never could jackasses.


You couldn't even control Ceausescu well
  53. I think it's important to point out that these propaganda outlets aren't meant for us to watch, what they are doing is reverse cargo cult, where they claim that "all the liberal forces are doing their best to contain outsiders" which is meant to tell the Russian population who listen to this drivel to think "oh so I guess we don't have it as bad as the people to the west of us, they also cheat and rig elections?).
  54. Criminals complain they cannot just steal without resistance.
  55. Wierd thing this, to make people vote for you, you need to have the talking points that people want.
  56.  And yet America turns a blind eye to all of this
  57. Can we propaganda about new King Moscow? Why does the Kremlin get all the fun?
  58. Other than Russia and the White House, it's hard to imagine anyone welcoming Putin's propagandists taking power
  59. Bop hoo
  60. They are actually being bold about invading NATO countrys?
  61. they can't take power in romania at all
  62. Can we take that as an admission of guilt to argue election interference from the Vodka Reich?
  63. nice next thing is that they actually believe that they are capable of occupying a European Country. Why dont you f*ck around and find out and see what happens
  64. F
  65. [Meanwhile Putin](https://i.imgflip.com/2u7l7u.png?a485472)
  66. Lol and one dude on discord told me I use "the russian intervention" term loosely, because I didn't simply vote for AUR...I should link him this.
  67. I wish there was a global task force to cyber attacks on Russia. Just drain the country.
  68. Russia admitting controlling the election.
  69. This unique brand of Slavic programming where fat middle aged/old men compete in impotent rage is my new fave
  70. Does anyone know the link of this Russian show?
  71. It‚Äôs mad how they‚Äôre so natural in saying the hidden part out loud and still some people on the west prefer to stay on their side trying to appease them, blows my mind really
  72. It‚Äôs funny how you just need to wait a little for Russia to confess to everything. You don‚Äôt need to waste your energy to disprove them in the moment - just wait a little. The question is: are people gonna do anything about those crimes they confess to?
  73. Romanian here! The other candidate named George Simion did so many fucked up things. He was a football gallery leader (he battled with jandarms constantly, being violent), he promised people apartments at 35.000‚Ç¨ and after winning the first round of elections said it was a marketing campaign, he screamed at a woman in the Romanian Parliment ("I will sexualy assault you, pig") and he said it will put CƒÉlin Georgescu as president just to name a few things. CƒÉlin Georgescu (the reason why the 2024 elections were canceled) is a very weird person ( he said that he will erase all political parties and other fucked up things). It was either Nicu»ôor Dan , freedom and pro-Europe or George Simion, CƒÉlin Georgescu and pro-Russia (anti-Europe). I forgot to mention that people working in the EU, mostly voted for George Simion. What a beautiful time to be romanian!
  74. Good
  75. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated just how much Russia suck. 

Kidnapping and torturing civilians their armed forces are just a buncha despicable thugs playing soldier. A supposedly global superpower relying on 'human wave' tactics, unreliable mercenaries and malnourished porn addicts from North Korea? 

No functioning logistics and maintenance, no air superiority and their Navy, what's left of it,  is run by alcoholics. 

Three years and 200.000 dead troops and 800.000 incapacitated cripples. Hundreds of billions in vehicles and equipment trashed.

Even having an American president sympathetic to them it sounds like a terrible idea for Russia to open more battlefronts to get quagmired in.
  76. Yes, because Georgescu would stand a better chance than Simion, wouldn't he? The 1 million vote difference between Dan and Simion *surely* wouldn't occur if Georgescu was the chosen one.

Really, the only thing that would be different is that Lasconi would be in the second round instead of Dan. You could argue that it's unfair to her, but she ran again and got 3% of the vote in the first round. Dan was clearly the preferred figure.
  77. Where's the video gone?!!!!
  78. What if you just stay behind the Russian border?!?!üò°
  79. This is exactly kind of scum adored by Trump ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è imho
  80. So...  A three day military operation to protect people is needed?
  81. They give up the game so easily.¬†
  82. Right into my veins
  83. The EU needs to stop tolerating the enemies of democracy within it. In order to join you need to be a fully functioning liberal democracy. If you stop being one, sanctions should follow and eventually expulsion.
  85. "Vladimir Putin's propagandists complain...." Reported other propagandists.
  86. Sure, let's ignore the intervention of France in the elections, Putin is at fault for that too ,obviously.

  1. For even more context:

Nicu»ôor Dan rents his small apartment in Bucharest and does not own his own. For a long time he has not had the money to buy his own home, and lately according to his own statements, he has had no time to organize all this.

He was raised in the suburbs of a smaller city, won Global math competitions not just with gold, but with perfect score! 

https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=1571

https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=nicusor+dan&btnG=

Yet, still, he is a decent person, comes from among the people, and is at heart an activist - thus against the corrupt system.
  2. Voted both of them :)
  3. Maia hii
  4. It‚Äôs heartwarming to see two absolute diamonds like this leading in Europe üíé
  5. Who needs Harvard when you got **Hardvard**?

But jokes apart, they really are great leaders with amazing qualifications. Hats off!!!
  6. Love them both so much üá™üá∫ first time in Romanian history when I didnt vote for the "lesser of two evil"
  7. still crazy that they had stiff competition from obviosly treasonous bastards who gives no two shits about regular people and is all about enriching and empowering themselves and their buddies, nevermind being putins vasals
  8. whoever put black text on a dark blue background, i hate you
  9. Let them cook üòé
  10. Alo, salut, sunt eu un haiduc
  11. American here, it‚Äôs nice to see Europe still believe education matters as part of leadership.
  12. omd actually qualified presidents, fucking finally
  13. Imagine if we all moved back to electing actually smart people rather than someone who reminds you of Bob down the pub..
  14. Really puts US to shame
  15. At least Romania & Moldova didn't end up with a pro russian president/government, unlike Slovakia or Hungary  
  
Sorry to be pedantic but there's a typo there. It isn't 'Hardvard' it's harvard.
  16. Sooo looking forward for them to meet which should be soon. Traditionally the first external visit of the Romanian president is in Moldova, next would be great France and Poland (I hope the pro UE candidate to win).
  17. BIG BRAINS HERE!!!! You hear that PUTLER?
  18. When Sorbonne met Harvard ‚ù§Ô∏è
  19. Nice to see this educated people leading Europe. 

Now only if Hungary and Slovakia can follow üòî
  20. As a Ukrainian I'm really happy for Romanian people and, of course, for Moldovan people. I don't know much about Dan, but Sandu is a great politician. Wise and professional. A true gem in modern times of screaming populists.
  21. As a Canadian, thank you Moldova and Romania for joining the correct side. Wishing you a happy future from Canada üá®üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá≤üá©üá∑üá¥
  22. I'm actually crying rn and i can't believe this is actually real. As a starting young adult in Romania for the first time i'm proud of my country.
  23. They are stacked hot damn
  24. And America chose the guy who eats soup with a fork. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  25. Who needs a mathematician when you can have a lobbyist that is lying to his own people and is not liked by his own people.
  26. It would be a real shame if we were to show this to Americans!
  27. Bulgarian here, our president is an absolute military dirtbag who tries to stop us from adopting the Euro in 2026 by all means possible even though he doesn‚Äôt have any power. I am positively jealous.¬†
  28. Big brain era :)
  29. Thank you Romania üá∑üá¥!
Your vote will let me visit your beautiful country.
  30. Wait so European countries are actually abel to vote for sane and smart politicians that arent racist or homophobic!
  31. Voting for smart people, that‚Äôs new. When did we start with that?¬†
  32. My ex-colleague, one of the smartest women I know, was voting for the guy on the left. That says everything to me.
  33. Proud of Romania's pro EU community. They left it all out there on the playing field.ü§ò
  34. Our MVPs üôè
  35. You went to Harvard? Haha how cute.

I went to HARDvard
  36. So?!?! America has a 34 felonie and 6 time bankrupt sexual rapist...beat that..#MAGA
  37. Then we have GIORGIA MELONI, MATTEO SALVINI and many more with proud high school diplomas
  38. The next couple of years in Romania (and Europe) will be decisive in regards to this being "the norm" or the last hoorah of a resemblance of Democracy in Romania. If Europe will struggle economically and the war in Ukraine will continue, while Nicu»ôor and the pro-Europe leaders will face challenges in making a positive impact, the next elections won't be kind. Our trust has been eroded time and time again and it's so easy for more and more people to fall for propaganda. On top of that, the last few generations who have lived through bad communism will dissappear, so that voice will be quiet. This is the last chance, I think
  39. The right-wingers are angry because they despise genuine talent and accomplishment.
  40. Maia has proven with a great track record that she's a good president.

I'm hopeful Nicusor will do the same and prove he was a wise choice (frankly, the only choice seeing what a sack of pro-russian dumb-rocks his opponent was). He did good as the capital's mayor but being a president is a whole different league.

Still i'm happy we've managed to vote for a civilized and educated person and i'm proud we avoided yet another russian trap.

Also man...we've gotta do something with these russians.
  41. And Hungary is ruled by Orb√°n......................
  42. love to see it! Now here's to hoping both of them will be able to keep winning against Russian propaganda
  43. The centrist technocrats save the day once again.
  44. I hope to one day see Romania and Moldova reunited, and I‚Äôm not ever from either of those countries.
  45. I am so happy for Romania!!
  46. Congratulations to both nations, seems like good choice.
  47. The american mind cannot comprehend this.
  48. Is Hardvard == Harvard on hard mode?
  49. Imagine them both having to sit and listen to Trump‚Äôs rambling in a meeting.
  50. So he knows about maths, huh
  51. And then there's donald, as thick as mince.
  52. It's so good that I honestly cannot believe it!!!!
  53. Didn't know he had studied at *Normale Sup*, he must be a pretty good French speaker.
For those wondering, it's the most selective and prestigious learning institution in France.
  54. Hardvard huh?
  55. Awesome, didn't expect if from Moldova. People want freedom!
  56. But Putin will ruin it.
  57. Personal union when!?
  58. In Italy high school diploma is enough, for the head of government at least. Austria (2020-21) too.
  59.  Worth knowing Rep of Moldova used to be part of Romania and most of it‚Äôs population have Romanian citizenship and more than 80% speak Romanian, even tho some call it Moldavian language which is Romanian with an accent.

Historical Moldova is now split in two:

One half is Rep of Moldova and the other half is part of Romania. Transilvania, Valahia and Moldova form today‚Äôs Romania.
  60. And they both have romanian citisenship
  61. I petition that the name of Harvard is changed to Hardvard. It sounds way funnier, and indeed, harder
  62. 45% of people voting for a traitor and russian troll is very bad indicator for humanity right now.
  63. Now kith
  64. ah yes, black font on a blue background, very visible.
  65. Hardvard
  66. Hardvard far tougher than Harvard
  67. Meanwhile in Germany we got a rich guy who can't stop running his mouth.
  68. Absolut Cinema
  69. Maia Sandu, President of Romania, 2035 - 2045
  70. make intelligence great again!
  71. I hope my two favorite nerds can find a path to unification
  72. Revenge of the nerds!
  73. I love you all but I'm gagging on hardvard.
  74. If they marry each other, will their countries form a union through marriage? The holy Romanian empire.
  75. Please do not do black on blue
  76. Where is this Hardvard University referenced? New one on me TBH.
  77. He kinda looks like John Goodman at first glance
  78. Pls don‚Äôt put black text on a dark blue background
  79. Pls don‚Äôt put black text on a dark blue background
  80. And it shows.
  81. He looks like Sergey Dorogov from Russian tv show
  82. This is great to see! I do have a genuine question: I don't know too much about Romania and Moldova, but I know that Moldova used to be a somewhat soviet version of Romania (oversimplified), so are there any efforts for a reunification between these two countries? Or are they embracing their separateness?
  83. Kenneth Brannagh must play him in a Biopic!!
  84. Gold medal at the Math Olympics, pretty impressive. The only gold medals Trump has are filled with chocolate.
  85. Congrats to both these countries, didn't let the far right trump supporting simpletons win
  86. Da fuq is "Hardvard" University
  87. President of USA‚Äî- school of my daady‚Äôs small loan

  116. A bright future for both countries.
  117. It would be so nice to live in a country with an educated, intelligent leader.
  118. I have only been following the Romanian elections. Did Moldova have a far-right candidate running as well and was Sandu's election a parallel to Romania's?
  119. I thought this was another hell where the loser claims they won.  As a us citizen I have begun going to the worst possible scenario regarding presidents.  So happy this is a good post!
  120. Sandu seems sketchy‚Ä¶‚ÄùUniveristy‚Äù ‚ÄúHardvard‚Äù?  I‚Äôd double check those transcripts‚Ä¶
  121. what's it like to have a reasonably intelligent and educated head of state?
  122. Hardvard?

  124. So what you are telling me is that no putin puppet managed to get inside ?

Good.
  125. In the US we elect morons, Boebert who had to take the GED 4 times to pass. Or a failed businessman.
  126. *cries in American*
I am so jealous and happy for those countries with educated and sane leaders. If nothing else, hopefully the US can serve as a cautionary tale for the rest of the world.
  127. A masters' degree from Hardvard sounds exactly like a Moldovan version of a degree from Harvard that's for sale on the dark web.

  163. Where the fuck is ‚Äúhardvard‚Äù university?
  164. Hardvard??
  165. Hardvard, hmmm
  166. They are educated and had good opportunities in life yes, but that doesn't mean they will be good leaders. Has anyone noticed how many people from Eastern Europe who attended Western universities later became high-ranking politicians? As if they were groomed daf√ºr
  167. I don't see how that Romanian guy won. Support for the right was so strong they un-did an election and then banned the winner. And we are supposed to believe after all that everyone chooses the moderate?¬†
  168. Hardvard? Tell me she isn't a pornstar?
  169. Looking forward to these countries taking in some muslim immigrants. Good luck!
  170. EU corruption at work.
  171. Europe crushed the rightfully elected president of Romania,  what a farce

  173. Roughly 46% voted for a chauvinist, hungarian-hater, cemetery desecrator, and around 54% "voted for" a candidate, who possibly will do as it pleases France, GB, NATO.

Hoping for the best possible outcome for all - it is never easy in Romania - yet too soon to pop champagne. With a bit of luck, Romania can diss a new Maidan.
  174. Nothing like the Bulgarian president: education - unknown, Russian asset - vatnik, elected by the most uneducated - the communists
  175. Sandu western pupet
  176. They both won thanks to the votes of people who don't live in the country, shame

  182. And absolutely NOTHING will happen lmfao hahahhahahhahaha
  183. If, god forbid, the AUR were to win in both these countries. Would they look towards unification? And if so, how much public support would it see?
  184. The president of Romania is the smartest president in the world.

The president of Moldova, being educated at Harvard, is a CIA asset.
